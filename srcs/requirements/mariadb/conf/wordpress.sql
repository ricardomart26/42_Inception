And welcome to the WordPress Briefing. The podcast where you can catch quick explanations of the ideas behind the WordPress open source project, some insight into the community that supports it, and get a small list of big things coming up in the next two weeks. I&#8217;m your host Josepha Haden Chomphosy. Here we go!</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[<strong>Josepha Haden Chomphosy </strong>00:00:40]&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Y&#8217;all, we&#8217;ve got an absolutely jam-packed couple of weeks in WordPress. We&#8217;ve got events happening and releases shipping and contributor days being coordinated (I almost said contributor days being contributed). That&#8217;s also what they&#8217;re doing. I&#8217;ll share some of those highlights in today&#8217;s small list of big things, but I did want to specifically call out something that&#8217;s coming up this week on Thursday (May 19, 2022), and that something is Global Accessibility Awareness Day.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The team of contributors over on the Accessibility team has participated in the Global Accessibility Awareness Day in the past. So I thought it would be interesting to hear from one of the co-founders of this particular day of awareness.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[<strong>Josepha Haden Chomphosy </strong>00:01:27]&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>All right. And with that, Joe Devin, would you like to tell us a little bit more about yourself?&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>[Joe Devon 00:01:34] </strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>Sure. So I am the co-founder of Global Accessibility Awareness Day, which is a day that goes viral every year on the third Thursday of May. We typically have the Twitter reach on the GAAD hashtag on Twitter of 200 million users, which is, I think, pretty much their active user count. We stopped counting once we hit their daily active user count. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>And then, I am Chair of the GAAD Foundation, which we launched last year. And then I have a day job too, where I&#8217;m CEO and co-founder of Diamond, which is an inclusive digital agency that builds software accessibly by default. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>[<strong>Josepha Haden Chomphosy </strong>00:02:15]&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Wonderful. Well, we are so excited to have you today. I said we like it&#8217;s me and the mouse in my pocket—we in the WordPress community that&#8217;s going to listen to this. Super excited to have you today. So you mentioned GAAD, Global Accessibility Awareness Day. Last year was your 10th anniversary, which is very exciting, but like with so many good things, I hear it all started with a blog post and a blog post on WordPress, no less.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>So I&#8217;d love to hear about how GAAD evolved from that, with, as I understand it, your co-founder of Jennison (Asuncion). That must be where you met him, I assume.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>[Joe Devon 00:02:51] </strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>Yes. Yes. So what happened was I started a WordPress blog called <em>My SQL Talk</em>. So it&#8217;s a database blog, and I just thought it was a brilliant name. I mean, My SQL Talk, like that, should be super popular.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And it probably had maybe ten people who ever looked. Um, and then my dad was getting older, and my dad was a survivor of the concentration camps, and he was a genius. He spoke ten languages. It, he was one of those people. That, when he walked into a room, he just commanded respect. You knew that there was history. I don&#8217;t know how to explain it really, but it was special when my dad walked into the room. And considering all of this that he suffered in his life, watching him get older and struggle, particularly with his banking, was very painful to see. And the bank wasn&#8217;t accessible, so I wrote this blog post proposing that we create a Global Accessibility Awareness Day.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Sometimes I get these visions, and they never turn into anything. But while I think about it, I&#8217;m like, &#8220;all right, let&#8217;s write this blog post and this can definitely work. Right?&#8221; And then you finish the blog post to hit send, and you&#8217;re like, &#8220;this is not going to work.&#8221;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>But I wasn&#8217;t even smart enough to do social media on it. But fortunately, WordPress had an auto-tweet feature, and it tweeted it out, and Jennison Asuncion, my co-founder, happened to be around and not out that Saturday night. And he read the blog post, and he said, &#8220;this is a great idea. Let&#8217;s make it happen.&#8221;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And we had two busy people, but we both had a community. He had the accessibility community, and I was building a tech scene in Los Angeles. And what I discovered is if you combine a great idea with the community, great things can happen. </p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>[Josepha Haden Chomphosy 00:04:49]</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>Oh man, you&#8217;re speaking my language over here, helping people find their communities, knowing that community is the thing that is the lifeblood of society.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>That sounded like a tautology. It is not a tautology. You can have a society with an attempt to not have any sort of community around it, but I bet it doesn&#8217;t work very well. Well, that&#8217;s, that&#8217;s very interesting. And so you all just kind of talked through what that would look like, I assume in confidence, or that would have to take place, right? Or was it on Twitter in those days?&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>[Joe Devon 00:05:24]</strong> </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Oh, you could still look in the comments and see the back and forth of Jennison and a bunch of other people that got pretty involved with GAAD that are some legendary folks in there. It&#8217;s kind of mind-blowing because I dunno how, how you feel, but for me, when I used to code, uh, three months later, I&#8217;d look back at old code and be like, &#8220;oh, I suck,&#8221; you know, or write an email even and you look back on it a day later and are like &#8220;what a stupid email, how stupid am I?&#8221; You know?  But I look back on that one after ten years; I was scared to look at it because I&#8217;m like, it must&#8217;ve been really bad. But you know, it kind of held up, and exactly what I wrote in there happened &#8211; to my utter shock.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>[Josepha Haden Chomphosy 00:06:06]</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>But also, it&#8217;s kinda nice, though, to look back and be like, &#8220;oh, I used to be much dumber.&#8221;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Cause then you&#8217;re like, look how far I&#8217;ve come. I&#8217;m no longer that dumb. I&#8217;m a different kind of dumb now; good for me. I always hope to be a different kind of dumb as I go forward. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>So then, okay, so that was your ten-year anniversary last year. GAAD, in general, now has been going on for 11 years, and at the time of this recording, in a couple of weeks, but then probably a week when it finally publishes, you have your next, your next round of that going.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>I think it seems safe to assume that awareness of the need for accessibility has increased during that time, but we all know that the work of accessibility is ongoing. And so, I&#8217;m just curious to hear from your perspective if the awareness of the need for accessibility has generally started to permeate developer communities.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And are you seeing more developer awareness around the need for accessibility in tech in general?&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>[Joe Devon 00:07:12]</strong> </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Yeah. You know, it&#8217;s not enough. It&#8217;s certainly improved a lot.  I keynoted a conference probably four years after GAAD started, maybe five, and I kind of assumed nobody would have heard of accessibility, and I was taken aback when I asked who had heard of it, and a good chunk of the room had. So even then, there had been a difference, and I&#8217;d say now I see accessibility mentioned a lot more in conferences and stuff. But when it comes to actually building it, there&#8217;s a tremendous amount of ignorance. There, there still needs to be a lot more awareness.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And I think partially people are a little bit scared to dip their toe because they&#8217;re scared that they&#8217;re going to be told that &#8220;no, it&#8217;s not accessible,&#8221; or that they&#8217;re going to say the wrong word or offend somebody. So I&#8217;d say that there&#8217;s some degree of trepidation, but also developers, and it&#8217;s not just developers, designers, and product people. There&#8217;s so much to learn, and it&#8217;s like, &#8220;oh God, there&#8217;s another piece that I have to learn.&#8221; </p>\n\n\n\n<p>And I&#8217;m so glad that you invited me on this podcast because it&#8217;s the developers that, you know, I am a developer, not anymore, I haven&#8217;t touched code in years, but that&#8217;s where I came from. Right? This is my peach, right? Particularly WordPress folks, because I had done a fair bit of WordPress before I moved on to some other things. And, I think we have to talk about usability and understand that accessibility is so much more than how we look at disability.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And if you don&#8217;t mind, I&#8217;m going to ask you a question. How do you think the typical WordPress developer or designer would define disability? </p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>[Josepha Haden Chomphosy 00:09:05] </strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>in the kinds of conversations that I&#8217;ve had over the years, it frequently has to do with visual things. Because it&#8217;s just screens all day, right? And that&#8217;s a primary area where our designers and developers really have made some effort.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>But my personal favorite sort of, of example, for like, when you&#8217;re looking at how to make sure that your products are accessible is, what, if you have to use your website, or you have to build your website using only one arm. Because that gives you an opportunity to kind of look at disability from a permanent standpoint.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Like if you have lost permanent use of one arm, but also gives you an opportunity to look at the temporary options for that sort of lack of mobility. Like you&#8217;re a mother with an infant, and so you have to be able to, you know, get your stuff done with one arm. And so I know that we paid a bunch of attention to screen readers and what works in not way back in 2018 and 2019 did a lot of work with. Literally zero screen. And can you still do the thing that you need to do, which was incredibly difficult. And I was really excited to see what our developers came up with around that. But I think that that is quite a bit of that discussion as we&#8217;re going through it from the beginning to the&nbsp;end.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>[Joe Devon 00:10:27] </strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>Yeah. I mean, that&#8217;s a great answer, and you definitely understand some of the nuances way better than I think that the average creator, digital product creator, I&#8217;m including the, you know, the product people, the designers, and the developers.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>[Josepha Haden Chomphosy 00:10:42] </strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>We&#8217;re very fortunate to have more than just developers in WordPress.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>[Joe Devon 00:10:50]  </strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>The reason I bring this up is that the WHO (World Health Organization) had to; they&#8217;re the ones that did massive research across the globe. And they had to, they had to come up with a definition, and in their definition, they needed to draw a line. Typically, I don&#8217;t remember the exact thing cause it&#8217;s a 350-page report, and I kept looking for where they defined it again.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>It was a little hard to find, but essentially it&#8217;s if there&#8217;s a major disability or a disability that impacts some significant portion of your day-to-day activities. And that&#8217;s really great when you&#8217;re trying to do a report on how many disabilities there are out there; what percentage of the population has a disability?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And their figures are something like 15% of the population has a disability, which is a huge number. But at the same time, they also mentioned that 2.2 billion people have a visual impairment. And we also know that over 33% of the population is over 50, and I&#8217;m included in that population. And I can say that when you&#8217;re over 50, you know, I&#8217;ve got clouds in my eyes.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>I don&#8217;t know where they came from, but they definitely make it harder to see. When I&#8217;m in a restaurant, I can&#8217;t focus on the person across from me the same way. My hearing is not the same, and anybody over 50 is going to have certain impairments and won&#8217;t see as well; color contrast issues are a big deal.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Being able to raise the font is a big deal. And I think that accessibility is connected in most people&#8217;s minds with disability. And they&#8217;ll attach that to something like being blind or being deaf or hard of hearing or having a missing limb or having some other kind of disability. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>And, as a result, they&#8217;re like, &#8220;well, I don&#8217;t even know any people in that category possibly,&#8221; and as a result, they&#8217;re like, &#8220;well, how important is this?&#8221; Yes. They might feel guilty. I should do the right thing. This is the right thing to do. But honestly, like how much money should I spend on it? How much, what percentage of my time should I spend on it?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And it&#8217;s because they don&#8217;t realize that everybody has different abilities. And so, I&#8217;m starting to go away from even talking about disabilities and asking people to remember that all of us perceive things differently. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Do you remember the gold dress where they were trying to say, what color is this dress? Is it gold and white or blue and black? And it is blue and black, but to me, all I see is gold and white. And then there was Laurel or Yanny. Do you remember that?. And some people heard it, and typically older people heard it as Laurel, and I&#8217;ve, and I do this in some of my presentations. I play that, that sound. And usually, it&#8217;s Laurel for me, but sometimes it&#8217;s Yanny. Even personally, it changes. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>And so, we have a totally different perception. Now think about memory. There&#8217;s a different kind of blindness. If you try and remember, let&#8217;s say a relative or a friend that is no longer. How well do you see that picture?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Because for me, it is very, very vague, but for some people, they say, and I&#8217;ve been asking people, and I&#8217;d love your answer as well. How vivid is it? And some people say, I can read the, I can see the pattern on the shirt. It&#8217;s as vivid as if I see with opening my eyes, seeing, you know, the regular in front of me, and I can even read a name tag in the memory.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And I&#8217;m like, Woah, so maybe I&#8217;m blind in a way. Right? So how do you see it? How do you remember things?&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>[Josepha Haden Chomphosy 00:14:42] </strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>Oh, I&#8217;m a, I&#8217;m a real visual person and a tactile person. And so, like if I interacted with someone, I&#8217;m very likely to be able to picture, like, recreate that mental picture pretty well in my mind. I recently, very recently, met some of my first people in that executive leadership space who were like, yeah, I don&#8217;t, I don&#8217;t visualize things.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And I was like, what are you, how do you do this work? Because like, you have to be able to do that. And they were like, no, I don&#8217;t have mental pictures.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>[Joe Devon 00:15:13] </strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>Some people don&#8217;t have an inner dialogue.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>[Josepha Haden Chomphosy 00:15:17] </strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>I don&#8217;t understand that either,&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>[Joe Devon 00:15:19] </strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>Me either. So accessibility studies all of these differences with respect to how you&#8217;re presenting all of this information.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And if you don&#8217;t pay attention to accessibility, you&#8217;re really just missing out. And then there&#8217;s colorblindness. If you&#8217;re creating something like slack that has an online/offline indicator, and you only use red and green for people who are colorblind, they see gray and gray. And so what I&#8217;m trying to teach the community with digital product creators is that no, you cannot ignore it.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>You can ignore accessibility, but then you&#8217;re not good at your job. I mean, I don&#8217;t mean to say it in an offensive way, but you&#8217;re not good at your job if you&#8217;re unaware. If you break a rule on purpose, great. But if you don&#8217;t know the rule, it&#8217;s just a lack of craft, and you absolutely should make it a priority.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And you&#8217;re not doing it as a charity. You&#8217;re doing it because you care about your users, and you care about your craft, and you want to build things well, and it&#8217;s a necessity. And I think that this is the kind of message that our community needs to hear.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>[Josepha Haden Chomphosy 00:16:31]</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>I want to touch on something that you sort of brought up a bit, um, at the start of the answer there.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>So you brought up the concept of usability. And in the last time that I did a podcast about accessibility, I defined accessibility as a subset of usability. Do you think that if we were to consistently draw that line for people so that it&#8217;s not just like accessibility is this thing that you should do outside of usability?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>If we were to more consistently draw that line, do you think that that would help people to see and understand better that its shades of existence, usability, and accessibility?  &nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>[Joe Devon 00:17:10] </strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>Oh, 100%, a hundred percent. And in my company, we kind of realized that that&#8217;s exactly what we have to do. We have to see this as usability.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And I don&#8217;t, we talk about accessibility a lot, but I don&#8217;t want to. It&#8217;s part of the plumbing for us. We&#8217;ve made it part of the plumbing, and I can tell you it&#8217;s a struggle to take accessibility and make it part of an organization, even when you&#8217;re bringing it top-down, believe it or not. For our teams, particularly the designers, they are blown away by what they&#8217;re learning because they&#8217;re improving their craft.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And design is typically where there&#8217;s a struggle to get accessibility accepted because there seems to be a very strong idea of what a design should look like. And I think it&#8217;s really about the approach because UX and design it&#8217;s all about empathy for people. And when you approach it, not as, even though empathy should mean that, that, you know, do the right thing at the same time, it&#8217;s more about empathy for your user, and your user includes so much more than just people with disabilities that you haven&#8217;t run into somebody that has that disability and therefore you build it better, and it&#8217;s, it&#8217;s completely blown their mind. They love it. They love doing it. And I&#8217;m not hiring people with accessibility coming in. We&#8217;re training them to work accessibly. </p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>[Josepha Haden Chomphosy 00:18:34] </strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>So I think it&#8217;s interesting that you talk about empathy as part of being able to make sure that you&#8217;re creating something that&#8217;s accessible because I actually feel like empathy is. Like it&#8217;s being considered this gold standard for many, many things right now. And I think it actually is more harmful in the long run than instead making altruistic choices.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And so, I have a blog post that I will link in our show notes that will kind of help everybody see more fully my concept there. But when you rely on empathy, you do kind of have to rely on one, being able to run into all of the issues you were mentioning. You have to know people who have problems in order to know that the problems exist.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And then you also kind of have to assume that once you have willingly put yourself into the discomfort of that kind of disability, whatever, wherever it exists on that spectrum, your experience of that discomfort is the same as someone who lives with it. And I just don&#8217;t think that we can necessarily do that.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>I always think that trying to do the altruistic thing, like doing your research and figuring out what it is and trying to make decisions on behalf of other people as best you can, which is a terrible thing. Still, like decisions that take into account the experiences that people are sharing with you and then going to them and saying, &#8220;does this make that experience better or worse?&#8221; is the more sustainable option from my perspective, this is specifically leadership. Still, I think it&#8217;s true for accessibility as well, and probably product design as a whole, but it&#8217;s very difficult. Like people really feel like they understand the concept of empathy right now. And I do think that sometimes that leads us down the wrong path for things.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>What&#8217;s your thought on that? I think you kind of agree based on what your answer was&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>[Joe Devon 00:20:33]</strong> </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Oh, no, absolutely. And you know, we, you, can&#8217;t never about us without us, as the common saying, and we&#8217;ve gathered a group of a hundred people with a wide variety of disabilities for research. Whenever we do any UX and research, and sometimes we&#8217;re asked to just do research projects, we go out and ask the users.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>We had some really interesting companies approach us to do innovation and accessibility, and they had strong assumptions. We looked at the assumptions and agreed with it, but we&#8217;re like, all right, they were smart. They said, &#8220;vet this with users for us, please,&#8221; because they didn&#8217;t want to gather their own group.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>We vetted with users, and we&#8217;re blown away, always blown away because there are so many things you just don&#8217;t know unless you&#8217;ve lived with a particular disability. You can&#8217;t guess, and you&#8217;ve got to speak to your users and a wide variety of them. &nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>[Josepha Haden Chomphosy 00:21:30]</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>Yes, absolutely. Absolutely. What role does open source play in expanding accessibility, either in specifically the digital space or just accessibility in general?</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>[Joe Devon 00:21:42] </strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>I guess if the question is, what role does it play? I would say the role it plays is it is, unfortunately, it makes accessibility worse because, for the most part open source is not very accessible. And it&#8217;s a personal passion of mine, so I&#8217;m really glad that you brought that up. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>You know, it is so bizarre. You write a blog post and then it goes viral, and it goes viral every year to a degree that you can&#8217;t even believe it, that all these companies that you know are running events. Privately, publicly talking about it. And then you get all these people thanking you for what you&#8217;ve done year after year.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And then one year, you read on Twitter, The Blind Onion; I&#8217;m sure you&#8217;re familiar with The Onion, the satirical clip, there&#8217;s the Blind Onion. And they tweet out, &#8220;Now that Global Accessibility Awareness Day is over, we look forward to 364 days of global accessibility oblivion.&#8221; And that really hurt at the time, but at the same time, and I was told to ignore it, don&#8217;t worry about it, but I&#8217;m like, no, this is coming from a place of pain.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And the point of GAAD was to make a difference. It wasn&#8217;t too to just give everybody an opportunity to say, &#8220;Hey, look at what we&#8217;re doing,&#8221; and then not make a difference. So, as a result of that, I started to think about, well, where are we with this? And, and so I&#8217;ve created a state of accessibility report that through my company, we&#8217;re able to run for a few years, and it&#8217;s not, you know, the state is not great.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And I&#8217;m like, well, what can we do to change things? So, as a result of all of this, I really wanted to figure out, well, what can we do to make sure that GAAD does make a difference? And so, I came up with the idea of the GAAD pledge, which is specifically meant for open source frameworks. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>And the idea of the GAAD pledge is that an open source framework, when they are ready, takes the pledge to make accessibility a core value of the framework. Now, terms of what that actually entails are different for every single project because every project is unique. We did create a bit of a framework, which had the idea of saying, okay, you&#8217;re going to, first of all, create an accessibility statement that says that this framework is going to conform to whatever, WCAG, which is Web Content Accessibility Guidelines, to whatever WCAG level is decided and is appropriate for the framework. That there&#8217;s going to be documentation for anybody that is downloading this piece of open source project and trying to implement it, that there should be guidelines for them, that all of the examples should be accessible. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>It&#8217;s really important because even the frameworks that try to pay attention to accessibility. You&#8217;ll often see that people from the community will provide examples, and they&#8217;re inaccessible. And it&#8217;s really sad when you see that because so many people are just copy-pasting. That&#8217;s typically how it works, and they&#8217;re going to copy-paste something bad. So putting a statement around it, I think, would be really great.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And what we&#8217;re hoping to see is that lots and lots of big open source communities decide to take the pledge. And then it&#8217;ll sort of be table stakes that any new open source projects as well look, all of these frameworks that made it, they took the pledge and therefore we should take the pledge as well.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And so the very first year, we had React Native take the pledge, and they put a lot of effort into their accessibility. The second group to take it was Ember.js, and they always put a lot of effort into their accessibility, and they continued that effort. We&#8217;re about to announce the next one, but we&#8217;re still two weeks away.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>So I can&#8217;t say anything yet, but yeah, we&#8217;re, uh, we&#8217;re hoping for a lot more uptake on, on the gap pledge because it, it affects so many people downstream. WordPress&#8217;s what percent of the web right now? 43%? So there you go. That&#8217;s so many people.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>[Josepha Haden Chomphosy 00:25:57] </strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>So many people. Yeah, fun fact Gutenberg, our current rewriting of the editing experience in WordPress, primarily uses React. And so, I&#8217;m glad to hear that they have taken that pledge as well. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>As with any good cooking, it starts with good&nbsp;ingredients.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>[Joe Devon 00:26:12] </strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>You said it. That was great. I wish I was a cook, though.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>[Josepha Haden Chomphosy 00:26:23] </strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>I love it. All right. Let&#8217;s what keeps you up at night when it comes to the state of accessibility?&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>[Joe Devon 00:26:29] </strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>What keeps me up at night is how to move the needle. It is such a big thing to change. And there are so many angles that you can approach this with, but at the end of the day, it&#8217;s, it&#8217;s a monster.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>It&#8217;s a monster. There are so many legacy sites out there. If you look at WebAIM, they do a yearly report on the state of accessibility as well. They call it the WebAIM Million, and they&#8217;re typically seeing 97% inaccessible, 98%. It goes up and down a little bit every year. And that&#8217;s, that&#8217;s just a huge boat to move.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>I think we need to at least get the newer, uh, newer websites and mobile apps to move. And what we&#8217;ve seen in our state of accessibility report is that only the very top companies seem to put in the effort to make their products accessible. There is a big push with the enterprise companies to do it.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The CEOs are starting to talk about it, but what we need is the entire culture of software development to change. Or I should even say digital product development change and to move that boat is massive. And that&#8217;s I put it in my tagline in my email like that&#8217;s my mission in life, and I hope to achieve it before I die.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>So that keeps me up at night.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>[Josepha Haden Chomphosy 00:27:52] </strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>I think that would keep me up at night as well. I mean, it seems like you are really just personally mission-driven and impact-driven. Do you feel like, in the event that the work that you&#8217;ve accomplished so far is what you accomplish, you feel still like you&#8217;ve had an impact?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>I feel like you have had&nbsp;an impact. </p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>[Joe Devon 00:28:13] </strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>I&#8217;m not one of those people that tries to have a legacy or like tries to focus on what my impact is and all of that. I just try and do good work. And hopefully, it just shows at the end of the day. I&#8217;m just trying to have the impact without the accolades.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>[Josepha Haden Chomphosy 00:28:34]</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>I get it. Well, Joe, thank you so much for joining us here on this episode of WP Briefing. You have been a delight to chat with.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>[Joe Devon 00:28:42]</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>Likewise, it&#8217;s really been a pleasure to meet you, and uh, and I appreciate the opportunity.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>[Josepha Haden Chomphosy 00:28:54] </strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>And now it&#8217;s time for our smallest of big things. As I mentioned at the start, it is packed. Number one tomorrow, May 17th, RC3. So one of the final RCs that we&#8217;re going to have for the WordPress 6.0 release, unless something goes horribly, horribly wrong, which I don&#8217;t think it will. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>And then, two days after that, Global Accessibility Awareness Day, as I mentioned, will be on May 19th. So, this coming Thursday. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>And then next week, we have the 6.0 release. We have the WordPress 6.0 release on May 24th. </p>\n\n\n\n<p> Three days after that, WordPress turns 19 on May 27th, starting its final teenage year before we turn twenty in 2023. So that was the rapid-fire dance card for the next two weeks.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The stuff that is happening with and around WordPress for everyone to know. As a heads up, also, many people are headed to WordCamp Europe in Porto(, Portugal). The first week of June, I am going to do a live from WordCamp Europe episode. It will not be live. I&#8217;ll just record it live. And so. You know you&#8217;ll get to hear me with my hoarsest voice and maybe singing to my computer. Cause that almost always happens at these things. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>And that, my friends, is your small list of big things. Thank you for tuning in today for the WordPress Briefing.

That means the project would love your help.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Thank you to everyone who has contributed towards testing and logging issues to help make WordPress 6.0 stable (and awesome). WordPress still needs your help testing, especially theme and plugin developers.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Since the RC1 release on May 3rd, 2022, there have been approximately 40 issues resolved in <a href=\"https://github.com/WordPress/gutenberg/commits/wp/6.0\">Gutenberg</a> and <a href=\"https://core.trac.wordpress.org/query?status=accepted&amp;status=closed&amp;changetime=05%2F03%2F2022..05%2F10%2F2022&amp;resolution=fixed&amp;milestone=6.0&amp;col=id&amp;col=summary&amp;col=status&amp;col=milestone&amp;col=owner&amp;col=type&amp;col=priority&amp;order=id\">Trac</a>.</p>\n\n\n\n<h1>Installing RC2</h1>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>This version of the WordPress software is under development</strong>. Please do not install, run, and test this version of WordPress on a production or mission-critical website. Instead, it is recommended that you RC2 on a test server and site.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>You can test WordPress 6.0 RC2 in three ways:</p>\n\n\n\n<ul><li><strong>Option 1: </strong>Install and activate the <a href=\"https://wordpress.org/plugins/wordpress-beta-tester/\">WordPress Beta Tester</a> plugin (select the “Bleeding edge” channel and “Beta/RC Only” stream).</li></ul>\n\n\n\n<ul><li><strong>Option 2: </strong>Direct download the <a href=\"https://wordpress.org/wordpress-6.0-RC2.zip\">release candidate version here (zip)</a>.</li></ul>\n\n\n\n<ul><li><strong>Option 3:</strong> When using WP-CLI to upgrade from Beta 1, 2, 3, 4, or RC1 on a case-insensitive filesystem, please use the following command:<br><code>wp core update --version=6.0-RC2</code></li></ul>\n\n\n\n<p>Additional information on the full <a href=\"https://make.wordpress.org/core/6-0/\">6.0 release cycle is available here</a>.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Check the <a href=\"https://make.wordpress.org/core/\">Make WordPress Core blog</a> for <a href=\"https://make.wordpress.org/core/tag/dev-notes+6-0/\">6.0-related developer notes</a> in the coming weeks, which will detail all upcoming changes.</p>\n\n\n\n<h1>Plugin and Theme Developers</h1>\n\n\n\n<p>All plugin and theme developers should test their respective extensions against WordPress 6.0 RC2 and update the “<em>Tested up to”</em> version in their readme file to 6.0. If you find compatibility problems, please be sure to post detailed information to the <a href=\"https://wordpress.org/support/forum/alphabeta/\">support forums</a> so that these items can be investigated further prior to the final release date of May 24th.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Review the <a href=\"https://make.wordpress.org/core/2022/05/03/wordpress-6-0-field-guide/\"><em>WordPress 6.0 Field Guide</em></a> for more details on this release.</p>\n\n\n\n<h1>Translate WordPress</h1>\n\n\n\n<p>Do you speak a language other than English? <a href=\"https://translate.wordpress.org/projects/wp/dev\">Help translate WordPress into more than 100 languages</a>.</p>\n\n\n\n<h1>How to Help Test WordPress</h1>\n\n\n\n<p>Testing for issues is critical for stabilizing a release throughout its development. Testing is also a great way to contribute to WordPress. If you are new to testing, check out this <a href=\"https://make.wordpress.org/test/2022/04/12/help-wanted-test-wordpress-6-0/\">detailed guide</a> that will walk you through how to get started.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>If you think you have run into an issue, please report it to the <a href=\"https://wordpress.org/support/forum/alphabeta/\">Alpha/Beta area</a> in the support forums.

Please do not install, run, and test this version of WordPress on a production or mission-critical website. Instead, it is recommended that you RC1 on a test server and site.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>You can test WordPress 6.0 RC1 in three ways:</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Option 1: </strong>Install and activate the <a href=\"https://wordpress.org/plugins/wordpress-beta-tester/\">WordPress Beta Tester</a> plugin (select the “Bleeding edge” channel and “Beta/RC Only” stream).</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Option 2: </strong>Direct download the <a href=\"https://wordpress.org/wordpress-6.0-RC1.zip\">release candidate version here (zip)</a>.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Option 3:</strong> When using WP-CLI to upgrade from Beta 1, 2, 3, or 4, on a case-insensitive filesystem, please use the following command:<br><code>wp core update --version=6.0-RC1</code></p>\n\n\n\n<p>Additional information on the full <a href=\"https://make.wordpress.org/core/6-0/\">6.0 release cycle is available here</a>.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Check the <a href=\"https://make.wordpress.org/core/\">Make WordPress Core blog</a> for <a href=\"https://make.wordpress.org/core/tag/dev-notes+6-0/\">6.0-related developer notes</a> in the coming weeks which will detail all upcoming changes.</p>\n\n\n\n<h1>What’s in WordPress 6.0 RC1?</h1>\n\n\n\n<p>Since Beta 4, various items have been addressed, including (but not limited to):&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<ul><li>Backport updates of Comment blocks tests (<a href=\"https://core.trac.wordpress.org/ticket/55643\">#55643</a>)</li><li>Backport a bugfix of Comment Template block pagination (<a href=\"https://core.trac.wordpress.org/ticket/55658\">#55658</a>)</li><li>Editor: Backport bug fixes for WordPress 6.0 from Gutenberg (<a href=\"https://core.trac.wordpress.org/ticket/55567\">#55567</a>)</li></ul>\n\n\n\n<p>WordPress 6.0 is the second major release for 2022, following 5.9 which became generally available in January. This release includes nearly 1,000 fixes and enhancements spanning most areas of the WordPress platform. Some key highlights within the content creation and site-building feature sets include:</p>\n\n\n\n<ul><li><strong>Style Switching:</strong> <a href=\"https://make.wordpress.org/core/2022/03/03/core-editor-improvement-choose-your-style/\">switch up the look and feel of your site</a>, all in one block theme. No need to change themes!</li><li><strong>More template options:</strong> use blocks to edit five more templates (author, date, categories, tag, and taxonomy).</li><li><strong>Multi-select: </strong>Easily select text across multiple blocks. Edit to your liking.</li><li><strong>Retain Styles: </strong>Keep your custom styles in place, whether transforming between blocks or creating new buttons.&nbsp;</li><li><strong>More patterns in more places:</strong> the Quick Inserter surfaces patterns that might work well for the condition you’re in, baking in relevant patterns for template parts and pages you’re working on.&nbsp;</li><li><strong>List View improvements: </strong>New keyboard shortcuts (shift + click) let you select multiple blocks to modify in bulk (reposition, delete, etc.), see your content at a glance with a collapsed by default view, and more.</li><li><strong>Refined design tools: </strong>Explore<strong> </strong>a new color panel, transparency options, more group block variations to create new layout options (Stack, Row), the ability to set your featured image in a Cover block, control the exact size of your featured image, gap support for the Gallery block, and more.</li><li><strong>New blocks: </strong>Various Post Comments, Read More, No Results in Query Loop, Post Author Biography, Avatar blocks.&nbsp;</li><li><strong>Block Locking: </strong>Choose to disable the option to remove a block, move it, or both, right in the editor.&nbsp;</li><li><strong>Export block themes: </strong>Explore the improved block theme export tool, as WordPress heads closer to codeless visual block theme building.</li></ul>\n\n\n\n<h1>Plugin and Theme Developers</h1>\n\n\n\n<p>All plugin and theme developers should test their respective extensions against WordPress 6.0 RC1 and update the “<em>Tested up to”</em> version in their readme file to 6.0. If you find compatibility problems, please be sure to post detailed information to the <a href=\"https://wordpress.org/support/forum/alphabeta/\">support forums</a>, so these items can be investigated further prior to the final release date of May 24th.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Review the <em><a href=\"https://make.wordpress.org/core/2022/05/03/wordpress-6-0-field-guide/\">WordPress 6.0 Field Guide</a></em>, for more details on what’s contained in this release.</p>\n\n\n\n<h1>Translate WordPress</h1>\n\n\n\n<p>Do you speak a language other than English? <a href=\"https://translate.wordpress.org/projects/wp/dev\">Help translate WordPress into more than 100 languages.</a> This release also marks the <a href=\"https://make.wordpress.org/polyglots/handbook/glossary/#hard-freeze\">hard string freeze</a> point of the 6.0 release cycle.</p>\n\n\n\n<h1>How to Help Test WordPress</h1>\n\n\n\n<p>Testing for issues is critical for stabilizing a release throughout its development.

I&#8217;m your host, Josepha Haden Chomphosy. Here we go!</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[<strong>Josepha Haden Chomphosy </strong>00:00:40]</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Tomorrow&#8217;s a big day. It marks the beginning of what is called the RC period, or release candidate period, for the current major release of the WordPress CMS. If you&#8217;re not super familiar with the way release cycles work, this is the point in the process where the code should pretty much be done changing.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>That way you can call in your designers, developers, and anyone else who builds things for others using your software. And they can either start testing their products on it, or they can figure out what new things they need to be able to teach their clients, whichever is most relevant to them. That is generally true for WordPress as well, but in true open source fashion, there is a caveat built in that helps us to get in last-minute, vital changes from contributors.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>We have a two-person sign-off rule that&#8217;s been around for about as long as I can remember, but lets things be added late in the release cycle, as long as there are two sign-offs from qualified contributors. Most of the time, those qualified contributors are lead developers of the project, but not always. We have a good group of people who are around helping us make sure that this is doable and the best thing that we can offer to all of our users.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[<strong>Josepha Haden Chomphosy </strong>00:01:50]</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And so, yeah, two-person sign-off, that is the little bit of release process trivia that you never knew you needed. And since we&#8217;re looking at a release trivia, kind of hidden bits of how software is made, I actually have a guest with me today, Channing Ritter. So Channing is a product and visual designer based in Brooklyn, New York.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>She&#8217;s a design director at Automattic and has been working on the WordPress project as a full-time sponsored contributor since January, 2021. She is joining us to share some behind the scenes intel on what&#8217;s going into the 6.0 release, her role in that process, and then we&#8217;ll just kind of see how the conversation goes from there.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[<strong>Josepha Haden Chomphosy </strong>00:02:40]</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Well, and with that, I&#8217;d like to welcome Channing to the WordPress Briefing. Hi Channing!</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[<strong>Channing Ritter </strong>00:02:45]</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Hey Josepha. Thanks so much for having me.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[<strong>Josepha Haden Chomphosy</strong> 00:02:48] </p>\n\n\n\n<p>I&#8217;m excited to have you here. If I understand, you are working on the design side of things with the release. So why don&#8217;t you tell me a little bit about the role you&#8217;ve played?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[<strong>Channing Ritter</strong> 00:02:59] </p>\n\n\n\n<p>I am. I am the design release lead for the 6.0 release. And if I understand correctly, this is a position that has been unfulfilled for the past few release cycles. So I&#8217;m kind of the first person to step in over the past few releases. And I think that&#8217;s really exciting, especially because design has started to play such a more important role in the WordPress project over the past few years.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>So it makes sense that design would have a seat at the table, and I&#8217;m really excited to be helping advocate for the design team and learning from other folks on the release squad. Who&#8217;ve been doing this for a while.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[<strong>Josepha Haden Chomphosy</strong> 00:03:33] </p>\n\n\n\n<p>So. First big question about 6.0, what is the feature that you are most excited about?&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[<strong>Channing Ritter</strong> 00:03:39] </p>\n\n\n\n<p>I&#8217;m most excited about the style switcher within the global styles panel. Um, so if folks still don&#8217;t know what I&#8217;m talking about there, it&#8217;s the ability to change between different variations of the theme.json without actually switching the theme.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>So this is a way to get a drastically different look and feels across your site with just a single click. And I see it as a really fun place to experiment and kind of get inspired for the different ways your site could appear without ever having to change your theme.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And in terms of the Twenty Twenty-Two variations, they&#8217;re just really gorgeous and all so diverse. Like you have the main default theme that has the deep green and kind of peachy colors and this really elegant type treatment with a really thin Serif typeface. But then the variations are so different from that. And I think my favorite one is the Swiss variation.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[<strong>Josepha Haden Chomphosy</strong> 00:04:36]</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The Swiss variation?&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[<strong>Channing Ritter</strong> 00:04:38]</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Yeah, every graphic design nerd loves Swiss design.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[<strong>Josepha Haden Chomphosy</strong> 00:04:42] </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Oh, ok! Now I know!&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[<strong>Channing Ritter</strong> 00:04:38] </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Really awesome things found in there. It&#8217;s a really high contrast, bold variation. It&#8217;s kind of black and white with red accents. I just love how different it is from the default style and how easy it is to change up your site and just get a whole drastically different look and feel.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[<strong>Josepha Haden Chomphosy</strong> 00:05:00] </p>\n\n\n\n<p>That&#8217;s excellent. So for folks who do not know what we&#8217;re referring to, when we talk about the Twenty Twenty-Two variation, that is the default theme, Twenty Twenty-Two. I&#8217;ll put a link to both the classic and block-based versions in our show notes, but you&#8217;ll want to use the block-based version to look at these style variations that Channing has mentioned here.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[<strong>Channing Ritter</strong> 00:05:24] </p>\n\n\n\n<p>You know, we&#8217;re really excited that the first-ever default block theme was released with 5.9, which is when Twenty Twenty-Two first went out and was bundled with 5.9.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>But now, with 6.0, I think even more so it&#8217;s starting to showcase the real power of block themes and what can actually be done there. And style variations is a huge kind of first step into this new world of block themes and starting to really open up the possibilities and all the flexibility that you have there.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[<strong>Josepha Haden Chomphosy</strong> 00:05:55] </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Yeah, absolutely. So when we&#8217;re talking about the Twenty Twenty-Two default theme, when we&#8217;re talking about switching these variations inside the theme itself, that seems to me to be a very user-focused kind of feature. And when we talk about users in WordPress, there&#8217;s a lot of room for interpretation. Like if we look at it kind of in a framework of three types of users of WordPress, you have, like end-users. So people who are site owners using it as a site to, like, enable their business.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>But you also have mid-end users—people who use it to build sites for others. And what I like to call back-end users, people who are using WordPress as a framework. And of course at the start of the Gutenberg project, way back in forever, a million years ago, one of the big calls to action that we had around even, like, trying to do this, was that we wanted to make WordPress easier for users. Just plain users.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And, and to me, that means making WordPress easier for those mid-end users, people who are creating WordPress sites for other people. But also should give some power and autonomy back to those end-users, the people who are using sites to enable their business or are site owners.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[<strong>Josepha Haden Chomphosy</strong> 00:07:14] </p>\n\n\n\n<p>And so in that context, between 5.9 and 6.0, do you feel like we have features that are really giving that kind of power and agency back to our end-users? Do you feel like we have some features that are really focused on those mid-end users, as opposed to our backend users? For a long time, we focused heavily on enabling our backend users, and now Gutenberg kind of moves us into those other two areas.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And so do you think that things like being able to switch between your style of variations, other things like that are moving us closer to that particular goal of Gutenberg?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[<strong>Channing Ritter</strong> 00:07:51] </p>\n\n\n\n<p>That&#8217;s a great question. I think it&#8217;s both. I think some of the features being released in 6.0 are absolutely going to empower that end-user.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Particularly in terms of improvements around design tools and some of the quality of life improvements. For example, partially selecting across multiple blocks and being able to partially select texts there. That&#8217;s the type of thing that really brings the writing experience in the editor to be on par with how you would expect a text editing experience to work.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And there are tons of small quality of life improvements in this release that I think are really gonna help those end-users. But there are also improvements around what we might call the maintainers who are building sites for others. I think block locking in particular is something that is really going to start filling a gap between people who build the sites and then people who do the day-to-day maintenance within a site.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>For example, in 6.0, we&#8217;re introducing some interface UI around block locking, but also there&#8217;ll be control around the ability to lock user roles.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[<strong>Josepha Haden Chomphosy</strong> 00:09:03]</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Which I think makes a lot of sense. I mean, we have all of these user roles in the CMS itself, and for a long time, we&#8217;ve just been like free for all on blocks, which was great and is great and should be available to people.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>But also if we are saying, like, it makes sense to have this gradient of users and their abilities for the CMS itself, and we are saying that we want to move control of the website and the content to be at the base layer in these blocks, then it also makes sense that we should be able to provide that same sort of granular level of access in the blocks.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>So I think that&#8217;s a great thing. If you all, if dear listeners, you do not know what we mean by “block locking,” I&#8217;m sure that I can find a link for us in our show notes below as well. If for anyone who&#8217;s been talking through Gutenberg things with me for a while, you know that this is one of the primary use cases that I think has been a long time coming.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[<strong>Josepha Haden Chomphosy</strong> 00:10:05]</p>\n\n\n\n<p>It was one of the first examples that I offered to folks when we had that question of like, who is this being built for? In what way is this beneficial to that mid-end user, as opposed to just giving all of the power and autonomy to users in a way that maybe is not the best for their visitors?&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>This is one of those use cases that made the most sense to me being able to say, okay, well, the opportunity to, as somebody who runs an agency and is building websites for people to be able to say, yeah, ‘You can do anything that is possible in this instance of WordPress and all the things that you are allowed to do will not break your instance. It won&#8217;t break your website’.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And so it gives a lot of time back to agencies to focus on their client&#8217;s most important problems, as opposed to not knowing how to update the hours in their footer or something like that. And so I&#8217;m very excited about that particular feature.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[<strong>Channing Ritter</strong> 00:11:01]</p>\n\n\n\n<p>It&#8217;s such a long-requested feature. I mean, we&#8217;ve been hearing requests around this particular feature for years and, you know, often when something gets requested over a span of years like that, it&#8217;s because there are some complexities to figure out how it works.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And that&#8217;s definitely been the case with moving forward with block locking. And there are a lot of nuances there. But I think what you were saying, I totally agree with. There’s always a push and pull. And as we enable more and more flexibility for end-users, there needs to be a little bit of push from the other side to kind of give more granular controls, more locking options, and make sure that everything can still be easily maintained.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[<strong>Josepha Haden Chomphosy</strong> 00:11:43]</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Yeah, we mentioned in that answer the concept of maintainers. If you are a contributor, it&#8217;s not <em>that</em> kind of ‘maintainer.’ So if you&#8217;re a WordPress contributor and we said maintainers there, um, just know that that&#8217;s not what we&#8217;re referring to. If you don&#8217;t know what I&#8217;m talking about when I say ‘contributor,’ there is a whole community of open source people and maintainers are people who specifically take care of a particular part of the WordPress software or the WordPress project, um, that makes all this possible.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>So there&#8217;s, ya know….&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[<strong>Channing Ritter</strong> 00:12:19] </p>\n\n\n\n<p>So true! The maintainer has another meaning in this context.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[<strong>Josepha Haden Chomphosy</strong> 00:12:20]</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Yeah, we have a mix in our audience and I love it, but it also makes me frequently spend like 10% of my podcast being like, by the way, when I said this, I didn&#8217;t mean you, but I did mean <em>you</em>, which makes it harder. I know.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>So. You’ve been with the project for a little bit, but if I recall correctly, this is the first time that you were, like, leading part of a release.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>So what would you say was the most challenging part of that?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[<strong>Channing Ritter</strong>  00:12:52] </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Another great question. This is my first time being this closely involved with the release. Although I was involved with the 5.9 release, but mostly in a release assets capacity. So I helped with the <em>About Page</em> and the welcome banner that goes on the dashboard.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>So I did get some insight in the last release cycle. Which was great preparation for being more involved as a release lead on this cycle. From the design perspective, one of the hardest things is always going to be figuring out what exactly goes into the release and what needs more time. In the sense, you know, that there might be some features that need to stay in the Gutenberg plugin for a while and get more testing before they get released to a much wider audience in a major WordPress release.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>So I think on the design side, we definitely have some goals that are big, long-term projects that are likely going to span across, you know, many releases, maybe even over many years. And I think the full site editor is a great example of that in a sense that it&#8217;s not something that you just were gone in one release and then it all gets released and then it&#8217;s all good to go.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[<strong>Channing Ritter</strong>  00:14:06] </p>\n\n\n\n<p>It&#8217;s something that has to be staggered across many releases, and there&#8217;s a lot of thought that goes into it; does this make sense in this more limited capacity, and what else needs to go in in order for this feature to go in? And the most complex things about the WordPress project is how interconnected things are.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>So when you start making those decisions about what should go in, what should get pulled out, often there&#8217;s sort of a domino effect of like, well, that would affect this feature and then, well, maybe they shouldn&#8217;t go in, or maybe this does need to go in. And that is really one of the most challenging, but also one of the most fascinating aspects of the release process.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[<strong>Josepha Haden Chomphosy</strong> 00:14:46] </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Yes. It is very, very true that there are kind of no small problems left in WordPress. *laughs* Yeah, when we, when we first started with this like bigger release squad, cause that has not been routine for the history of the project. When we first started with that, I know that expanding out the exposure to like how much one change affects 25 different things was really, it was really good for all of us to be reminded.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And as I mentioned at the top of our episode today, tomorrow begins the RC period. It begins the release candidate period, which is when it&#8217;s supposed to be, as locked down as possible. But if you all have been following along with our release process in general, which if you&#8217;re listening to this, you probably have, you know that last week or a couple of weeks ago, we had this whole question about the Webfonts API, and we had that conversation in a public space as best we could,&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Like, there are always things that you can&#8217;t, like, fully disclose in public spaces, but we had a very open and transparent conversation about, like, who is most affected by putting it in, in the state that the API was in. And, who&#8217;s most affected if we take it out. And where can we make compromises on either side so that both sides are a little happy and a little unhappy?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[<strong>Josepha Haden Chomphosy</strong> 00:16:09] </p>\n\n\n\n<p>And, like, that is all so hard to do. Not only in general. We have a 20-year-old code base and a five-year-old code base. And it&#8217;s all a big, big undertaking to understand what is happening and where it happens. And so there&#8217;s this moment always when we are trying to decide, like, is this baked enough? Did we put it in too early? Should we pull it out? How, if we pull it out, did we ask people to do too much work before we decided to pull it out anyway?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Like, you always have those kinds of questions about it. And honestly, I think that most of us weren&#8217;t around the last time, that WordPress was, was this experimental in public, like it&#8217;s always been open source. It&#8217;s always been experimental and iterating publicly, which is just the hardest way to work on anything. We like, we shipped our best guesses. Don&#8217;t be mad. It&#8217;ll be… we&#8217;re coming for it. We&#8217;re going to fix it. Like, that&#8217;s always hard, but the last time around, when it was this substantial a change was, like, 2008 or something, like, it was ages and ages ago.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[<strong>Josepha Haden Chomphosy</strong>  00:17:14] </p>\n\n\n\n<p>And we were smaller than, we had a smaller number of contributors. We had a smaller group of people actually using the CMS. And so over time it has gotten more and more complicated. And, and I don&#8217;t think that we can ever understate the complexities of that. And so for you, you had a little bit of exposure to it in 5.9 and then showed up for like really doing it in 6.0.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Has it been a surprising change? Like, were you surprised much more by how complicated it was when you were closer to it?&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[<strong>Channing Ritter</strong> 00:17:47] </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Yeah, definitely. It’s been a real learning process, especially coming to understand how much there really are no easy answers. I think a lot of us are in the release squad are real problem solver types of people and, and want it to, you know, be a really neat, tidy answer.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And it&#8217;s not always the case. You know, sometimes parts of the feature might go in, or some contingency plan might get put into place and things didn&#8217;t go exactly as planned. But what you said of being an experiment and being on kind of the cutting edge of trying out new things, I think there is a lot of passion around that in the WordPress project.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Right now, we&#8217;re in such a transitional period for the project, you know, moving from classic themes to block themes and really changing the ideas of how we approach designing sites. And because of that, I think there is a lot of momentum and energy around getting new features, as many new features as possible into each release. But there&#8217;s also, you know, a lot of testing and stuff that needs to happen.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And to make sure that, like you said, these things aren&#8217;t going out too early.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[<strong>Josepha Haden Chomphosy</strong> 00:19:01] </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Well, and there&#8217;s always that difficulty, we&#8217;re going to just leap right into open source areas now. There&#8217;s always that difficulty around, like, there&#8217;s this concept that when, like, we always want to ship something that doesn&#8217;t break backward compatibility when possible, we don&#8217;t want to ship vulnerabilities. Like, that&#8217;s always true, but we are in an open source project, and open source projects are necessarily kind of tolerant of like, that&#8217;s not our best, but like it skates, right?&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>This was, we aimed for Ferrari and got a skateboard because sometimes you got to start with a skateboard, right? *laughter* Like if it gets you from one place to another, that&#8217;s kind of where we&#8217;ve got to aim some days.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[<strong>Channing Ritter</strong> 00:19:45] </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Totally.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[<strong>Josepha Haden Chomphosy</strong>  00:19:46] </p>\n\n\n\n<p>And that&#8217;s always so, so difficult, especially cause, like, for the big change that 5.0 represented, and that 5.9 represented– 6.0 is not as big a shock as 5.9 was.&nbsp; But, like, as big a change as those represented, it still skates. And that&#8217;s, I think what makes the work especially hard, especially nuanced. And like, we haven&#8217;t gotten together as human beings in two years. And so sometimes people just kind of forget there&#8217;s a human being back there.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>We&#8217;re humans. Everyone be nice. Yeah. I don&#8217;t know that part of running a release definitely was surprising to me. My first release that I ran was 5.0 and…</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[<strong>Channing Ritter</strong> 00:20:31] </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Oh, wow!</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[<strong>Josepha Haden Chomphosy</strong> 00:20:32]</p>\n\n\n\n<p> Yeah, it was, like, that was  2018. And then I became the executive director at the top of 2019. And I distinctly remember one core chat where I showed up and just was like the most transparent, vulnerable person we&#8217;ve ever experienced in life.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>That&#8217;s not true. We have very vulnerable people in the project and very transparent people, but I told everyone like, there are a million of you and one of me, and it&#8217;s kind of terrifying that you&#8217;re leaping on me in this—like you&#8217;re scaring me a lot right now. And that was quite a thing to say to like, all these… it&#8217;s terrifying! Right?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[<strong>Channing Ritter</strong> 00:21:12] </p>\n\n\n\n<p>I love when you see that type of vulnerability in the project. I think it takes… it takes a degree of comfort and familiarity with the project to even be able to admit to that. And to me, that&#8217;s a real sign of growth in the project. Like when I first started contributing, I don&#8217;t think I ever would have just said, like, ‘How is the feature supposed to work? I have no idea.’ That&#8217;s something that I say all the time now.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>*Laughter*</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And you know, that is completely fine and more than okay. It&#8217;s a massive project. There are folks who have done deep thinking about a feature over the course of years. You know, and there are experts who can help shed light on various problems that maybe you just haven&#8217;t had a chance to dive into yet and really understand the nuances of yet.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>So that&#8217;s the amazing thing about open source is that you can lean on folks who do have expertise in that particular area. You&#8217;re not expected to be an expert-expert in every single domain. It&#8217;s okay to say, I don&#8217;t really have a good idea or a good concept of this feature. I don&#8217;t have a good feeling for it. What do other folks think?&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[<strong>Channing Ritter</strong> 00:22:24] </p>\n\n\n\n<p>And even people who have been in the project for a long time, decade plus, still say that all the time. You know, or you might just say, like, I have a really rough idea of how this works, are other people seeing this the same way? Or did other people have a different, you know, mental picture of how this might work?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Even if, sometimes it feels like you&#8217;re over-communicating, it&#8217;s really helpful because often people do have really dramatically different ideas about how a feature might take shape.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[<strong>Josepha Haden Chomphosy</strong> 00:22:49] </p>\n\n\n\n<p>And I hope that&#8217;s one of the things that we never lose in the project. Like we are an old, old project now and we support a bunch of the web with a tiny, tiny group of people compared to the amount of the web that we support.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And I hope that we always have that opportunity as senior leaders, which I am, and all of our upcoming leaders to all of us, just at some point, be like, can we stop the train? I don&#8217;t understand. I don’t understand that. Um, and not necessarily feel that that has made us a worse contributor. Cause I think that it&#8217;s when we are transparent about our lack of understanding.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>That&#8217;s when we have the opportunity to make what we&#8217;re offering to the world more solid and always better.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[<strong>Channing Ritter</strong> 00:23:35] </p>\n\n\n\n<p>I love it. I think it&#8217;s the, one of the most lovely things about the WordPress community. There&#8217;s really low judgment around those types of questions and people are really inclusive and more than happy to take a moment to explain something to you or shed some light on an issue you might not have thought that much about.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>I think that&#8217;s one of the best things you can always reach out for help. And folks are always willing to provide guidance or context or even historical information about, you know, whether it&#8217;s been tried in the past or previous explorations and that sort of thing.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[<strong>Josepha Haden Chomphosy</strong> 00:24:10] </p>\n\n\n\n<p> All right. Well, that covers all of my questions for you. Do you have a final thought about the release that you would like to share with everyone you don&#8217;t have to, if you don&#8217;t want to, not everyone has like a final sign off.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[<strong>Channing Ritter</strong> 00:24:25] </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Yeah. One of the things I&#8217;m most excited about for this 6.0 release is all of the improvements around design tools.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And these are just small improvements around a ton of different things, like the color panel, border controls, gap support, typography options, flexible container blocks, etc. These are the types of tools that are a designer&#8217;s dream. You know, they really make the difference between being able to make a really crisp, finished looking final product and having something that&#8217;s a little rough around the edges.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And as a designer, like those are the things that your eye goes straight towards. And all of these nuanced new tools, they really allow designers to have that fine detailed control to create really pixel perfect sites. And I think that&#8217;s something that, you know, myself and a lot of others on the design team are just so beyond excited about.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[<strong>Josepha Haden Chomphosy</strong> 00:25:25]</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Excellent. Well, Channing, thank you so much for joining us today on the WordPress Briefing; it has been an absolute delight.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[<strong>Channing Ritter</strong> 00:25:32] </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Thank you for having me.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[<strong>Josepha Haden Chomphosy</strong> 00:25:41] </p>\n\n\n\n<p>And now it is time, woohoo, for the small list of big things. My favorite part of this podcast, that&#8217;s not true. I have a lot of things that I love about this podcast. I just, in particular love being able to share like three things that are coming up in the next couple of weeks that everybody should be aware of. And I really particularly like the list I have this week.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>First as of today, we are two weeks away from WordSesh. If you&#8217;re looking forward to your first in-person WordPress event, but feel like you could use a little foundation information, a little bit of a WordPress primer, then this event has a lot of excellent thought leaders in the project that you can learn from.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>If you&#8217;re looking for more practical or hands-on opportunities, uh, you can also check out social learning spaces. All of those are free for anyone. So I will include links to both of them in the show notes.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[<strong>Josepha Haden Chomphosy </strong>00:26:30]&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Second, as of today, we are four weeks away from WordCamp Europe. This is one of our flagship events. So it also includes a contributor day, which I encourage you to look into. If you have never heard of one before. I will be there to meet some of the contributors that have joined the project since the end of 2019. And hopefully, I will see you there as well. If you&#8217;ve never heard of a contributor day, then I&#8217;ll include a link to the beginner&#8217;s guide to contributions, a little talk that I gave in 2017 in the show notes that should help you get your bearings or at the very least know what questions to ask yourself to figure out if a contributor day is right for you.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And then the third thing as of today, it has been one week since <a href=\"https://profiles.wordpress.org/iandunn/\">Ian Dunn</a> and the <a href=\"https://make.wordpress.org/meta/\">Meta</a> developers… Um, that sounds like a band… Ian Dunn and the Meta developers connected the props channel in the community Slack to WordPress.org profile activity. I&#8217;m really excited about this. It&#8217;s the first in a long list of changes that are part of a larger project to credit more non-code contributions, more contributions that are not specific to a major release or event.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And also to set us up to be able to provide more quality checks and balances for our growing Five for the Future program. If you&#8217;ve not been over there lately, if you&#8217;re not super sure what I&#8217;m talking about, there&#8217;s a link to the discussion post that we had about it, but also you can wander right over into the Making WordPress Slack and check out the props channel to just kind of see a running list of contributors that people are really grateful for. Which, frankly, if you ever are having a bad day, that is a wonderful place to just kind of wander in and see all of the positive vibes that people are sending around to each other.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Uh, yeah, so the props channel, is always good. Uh, and that my friends is your small list of big things. Thank you for tuning in today for the WordPress Briefing. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>I&#8217;m your host, Josepha Haden Chomphosy. And I&#8217;ll see you again in a couple of weeks.</p>\n\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}s:30:\"com-wordpress:feed-additions:1\";a:1:{s:7:\"post-id\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:5:\"12742\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}}}i:7;a:6:{s:4:\"data\";s:75:\"\n		\n		\n		\n		\n		\n				\n		\n		\n		\n		\n		\n		\n		\n\n					\n										\n					\n		\n		\n			\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";s:5:\"child\";a:4:{s:0:\"\";a:6:{s:5:\"title\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:31:\"People of WordPress: Meher Bala\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"link\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:66:\"https://wordpress.org/news/2022/04/people-of-wordpress-meher-bala/\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:7:\"pubDate\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:31:\"Sat, 30 Apr 2022 09:20:54 +0000\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:8:\"category\";a:7:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:9:\"Community\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}i:1;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:8:\"Features\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}i:2;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:10:\"Interviews\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}i:3;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:9:\"HeroPress\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}i:4;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:19:\"People of WordPress\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}i:5;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:15:\"WordCamp Mumbai\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}i:6;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:16:\"wptranslationday\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"guid\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:35:\"https://wordpress.org/news/?p=12706\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:1:{s:0:\"\";a:1:{s:11:\"isPermaLink\";s:5:\"false\";}}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:11:\"description\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:106:\"This month\'s People of WordPress feature shares the story of developer and e-commerce builder Meher Bala. \";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}s:32:\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\";a:1:{s:7:\"creator\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:28:\"webcommsat AbhaNonStopNewsUK\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}s:40:\"http://purl.org/rss/1.0/modules/content/\";a:1:{s:7:\"encoded\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:16637:\"\n<p>In this series, we share some of the inspiring stories of how WordPress and its global network of contributors can change people’s lives for the better.

From using the software as a basic website tool to helping entrepreneurs and good causes around the world fulfill their aspirations, she has overcome personal barriers and now aims to inspire others.</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>Meher found her vocation and learned new skills through WordPress. She also discovered a way to encourage other women to consider careers in IT.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<h2>Opening the doors to a career in technology</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>As a child, Meher was diagnosed with dyslexia (difficulty in reading the written word) and dyscalculia (difficulty in comprehending numbers and mathematical functions). With the support of her parents and a tutor, she was able to overcome this learning obstacle. She developed coping techniques and a determination to work to overcome challenges as they appeared later in life.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>In school, she got an opportunity to replace one subject with computer studies as an alternative. This proved to be an eye-opener to future career possibilities.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>She began to research not only what the internet had to offer but also how it worked, including the new and fascinating concepts of email and websites. Her father bought the family’s first desktop computer so she could do her research at home.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Meher’s father wanted to turn her love for computers into something that would serve her well in the future. In 2005, he enrolled her in a short computer course from a global IT training provider. The course tutor was so impressed with her performance, she was advised to enroll in a four year software development course.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>That meant she had studied the software development course alongside her higher education college course. Looking back, she enjoyed the dual challenge of the degree course in commerce, and the experience prepared her well to keep learning software while working as a developer. Within three years, she had learned C#, C, C++, HTML, Java, and .NET. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>After graduation, she was in a dilemma to choose between commerce and IT. What to choose? She had a compulsory one-year technology internship to complete, and her choice of focus for that year would prove to be a defining moment.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>In 2009, on her birthday, Meher was offered an internship. On the first day of the internship, she was introduced to WordPress. Her initial assignment was to change the look and feel of the WordPress dashboard — in just six hours. But there was a problem &#8211; she had never worked with WordPress before!</p>\n\n\n\n<blockquote class=\"wp-block-quote\"><p>&#8220;I stared at the whiteboard and thought that task given was impossible and difficult to meet the deadline. I wondered if my boss was joking and did not know then what you could do with WordPress as a developer and how it could slot into your toolbox. It opened my eyes.&#8221;&nbsp;</p><cite>Meher Bala</cite></blockquote>\n\n\n\n<p>Meher used her research skills to know more about using WordPress. She found a plugin that would help her achieve her task. She met the deadline and it ingrained an interest that she would never lose. </p>\n\n\n\n<h2>Re-discovering WordPress</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Five years after her initial WordPress experience, Meher was assigned to lead an international project in WordPress.&nbsp;She was hesitant — she had lost touch with the CMS during that five years, but the project was a great opportunity to become a team leader and lead from the front.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>She decided to update her WordPress skills, relying again on the strength of her research skills and determination. In the process, she also taught her team all about WordPress, inspiring many of those members to continue to develop their WordPress skill set.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The success of that project was a pivotal moment for Meher and a new dawn as a developer specializing in WordPress.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>As a team lead, Meher soon found it was not possible to always have all the answers straight away. She found internet searches gave practical solutions—but rarely explained the theory behind it.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>So she went looking for a WordPress group to help her expand the scope and depth of her knowledge.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2>Finding the community and its developer learning opportunities </h2>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-full\"><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"999\" height=\"667\" src=\"https://i2.wp.com/wordpress.org/news/files/2022/04/dsc_00345.jpg?resize=999%2C667&#038;ssl=1\" alt=\"Meher at WordCamp Nagpur in 2017\" class=\"wp-image-12762\" srcset=\"https://i2.wp.com/wordpress.org/news/files/2022/04/dsc_00345.jpg?w=999&amp;ssl=1 999w, https://i2.wp.com/wordpress.org/news/files/2022/04/dsc_00345.jpg?resize=300%2C200&amp;ssl=1 300w, https://i2.wp.com/wordpress.org/news/files/2022/04/dsc_00345.jpg?resize=768%2C513&amp;ssl=1 768w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 999px) 100vw, 999px\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\" /><figcaption>Meher enjoying being part of <em>WordCamp Nagpur in 2017</em></figcaption></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>In 2015, while browsing Facebook, Meher came across an advertisement for something called WordCamp Mumbai, an event that had taken two days before. She did a little digging to learn what a WordCamp was, and about the people behind it. She took the plunge and joined the WordPress Mumbai Meetup group.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Her first Meetup experience was not love at first sight. She felt the topics were for advanced users, and the timing late in the evening made it difficult to attend.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>But a few months later, the Meetup addressed a topic that could help her resolve an issue in one of her current projects. She made the effort to show up and came away with a number of important tips.&nbsp;The speaker had taken the time to speak to individual attendees. When he came to Meher, she took the opportunity to ask a couple of questions about her project issues. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Thereafter she went to more Meetups and got to know the people behind this group, just as they started talking about WordCamp Mumbai 2016.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2>A WordCamp adventure</h2>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-full is-resized\"><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://i1.wp.com/wordpress.org/news/files/2022/04/wcm16.jpg?resize=600%2C800&#038;ssl=1\" alt=\"Meher pictured with the WordCamp Mumbai 2016 sign \" class=\"wp-image-12758\" width=\"600\" height=\"800\" srcset=\"https://i1.wp.com/wordpress.org/news/files/2022/04/wcm16.jpg?w=600&amp;ssl=1 600w, https://i1.wp.com/wordpress.org/news/files/2022/04/wcm16.jpg?resize=225%2C300&amp;ssl=1 225w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 600px) 100vw, 600px\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\" /><figcaption>Meher discovering <em>WordCamps in Mumbai in 2016</em></figcaption></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>Meher expressed interest in being a part of the coming&nbsp; WordCamp Mumbai and started in an entry-level role with basic responsibilities.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>At first, she thought WordCamp was a formal conference with about 100 people. So on the first day of WordCamp Mumbai 2016, she was surprised to see so many WordCamp enthusiasts attending and enjoying such a relaxed and friendly conference.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>After that great experience, Meher went to many more meetups and did more volunteering. She started taking on responsibilities in the coming WordCamps and getting to know the different aspects of the camp.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>In the following years, at each WordPress, she took up a new role like speaker vetting, sponsors, and volunteer coordination. This allowed her to know more about what an organizer needs to do, from planning to execution, to make WordCamp a successful event.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-full\"><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"900\" height=\"600\" src=\"https://i2.wp.com/wordpress.org/news/files/2022/04/wcmumbai-17.jpg?resize=900%2C600&#038;ssl=1\" alt=\"WordCamp Mumbai 2017 group photo of the team\" class=\"wp-image-12765\" srcset=\"https://i2.wp.com/wordpress.org/news/files/2022/04/wcmumbai-17.jpg?w=900&amp;ssl=1 900w, https://i2.wp.com/wordpress.org/news/files/2022/04/wcmumbai-17.jpg?resize=300%2C200&amp;ssl=1 300w, https://i2.wp.com/wordpress.org/news/files/2022/04/wcmumbai-17.jpg?resize=768%2C512&amp;ssl=1 768w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 900px) 100vw, 900px\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\" /><figcaption>With the team at <em>WordCamp Mumbai in 2017</em></figcaption></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>Meher is grateful for her WordPress journey which was fostered in the Mumbai community. It has been filled with beautiful surprises.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>When people ask why she’s chosen to specialize professionally in WordPress, Meher says WordPress is easy to teach a non-technical person, yet it is still highly customizable. Being a WordPress developer has given her the opportunity to work&nbsp; remotely for global web development companies that let her think out of the box. And she learns new skills with every release.</p>\n\n\n\n<h3>The community makes WordPress special</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Meher says that some of her most memorable WordPress moments have revolved around special friendships, trying new things, and participating in community building.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>WordPress has let her explore different parts of India, make new friends locally and internationally, and encourage women to be a part of meetup groups and events across India.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>One of Meher’s biggest dreams was to lead WordCamp Mumbai as a lead organizer and show others what could be achieved by working together in open source. In 2019, she did just that and has volunteered at international WordCamps and meetups since.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"1024\" height=\"515\" src=\"https://i0.wp.com/wordpress.org/news/files/2022/04/wc-19.jpg?resize=1024%2C515&#038;ssl=1\" alt=\"Meher speaking at WordCamp Mumbai 2019\" class=\"wp-image-12731\" srcset=\"https://i0.wp.com/wordpress.org/news/files/2022/04/wc-19.jpg?resize=1024%2C515&amp;ssl=1 1024w, https://i0.wp.com/wordpress.org/news/files/2022/04/wc-19.jpg?resize=300%2C151&amp;ssl=1 300w, https://i0.wp.com/wordpress.org/news/files/2022/04/wc-19.jpg?resize=768%2C386&amp;ssl=1 768w, https://i0.wp.com/wordpress.org/news/files/2022/04/wc-19.jpg?w=1247&amp;ssl=1 1247w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\" /><figcaption>Taking to the stage at WordCamp Mumbai in 2019</figcaption></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>As part of her enthusiasm for sharing the opportunities WordPress can give people, especially women, she has given time to co-organize two global <a href=\"https://wptranslationday.org/\">WordPress Translation month long events</a> and contributor events in India.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Meher said: “I was first introduced to translation at one of the meetups which was organised to support the WordPress Translation Day. I realized this was another way to support my local communities and bring the power of WordPress to them by contributing in Gujarati and Hindi. I did not imagine I would a few years later be a global organizer for the event itself!”</p>\n\n\n\n<p>With her commitment to ongoing learning as a developer and to model what she believes about the value and community growth opportunities of open source, Meher has given time and energy to the Marketing Team, where she has been a Team Rep, to the Training Team, and to the Core Team contributing to multiple releases.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<h2>The developer adventure with WordPress is unlimited</h2>\n\n\n\n<blockquote class=\"wp-block-quote\"><p>At the start of my software developer journey, I always thought the C++ and Java were the only skills you required to excel in your career. From the time I started exploring WordPress in depth, I realized the potential and the power of WordPress in web development.</p><cite>Meher Bala</cite></blockquote>\n\n\n\n<p>Being a part of the WordPress community, Meher learned that there is so much more than just building blogs on WordPress. She started exploring different features of WordPress, created her first theme, and eventually specialized as a frontend specialist.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Meher now works as a consultant and front end developer with an international agency specializing in WordPress. Asked what she thought was the best thing about being a WordPress developer, Meher replied: &#8220;Through WordPress, I have an opportunity to build unique out of the box websites and work&nbsp;remotely for global web development companies that encourages you to think out of the box. There is always opportunity to continuously advance my coding skills and learn new techniques with every release.&#8221; </p>\n\n\n\n<p>She believes that there is no limit to where using the software can take you and what you can combine it with to find solutions to projects big and small.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>If you earn a living from WordPress, her advice is from the heart: try to give back to the WordPress community.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>“I am sure you will learn or teach something new and definitely make friends across the world. There is no shame in making mistakes, as you can learn from them and develop your skills further. You can also help others as they build their skills.”</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Meher added: “Don’t let the things you find difficult get in the way of your success.”</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 id=\"share-the-stories\">Share the stories</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Help share these stories of open source contributors and continue to grow the community. Meet more WordPressers in the <a href=\"https://wordpress.org/news/category/newsletter/interviews/\">People of WordPress series</a>.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2>Contributors</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Thanks to Abha Thakor (<a href=\'https://profiles.wordpress.org/webcommsat/\' class=\'mention\'><span class=\'mentions-prefix\'>@</span>webcommsat</a>), Larissa Murillo (<a href=\'https://profiles.wordpress.org/lmurillom/\' class=\'mention\'><span class=\'mentions-prefix\'>@</span>lmurillom</a>), Mary Baum (<a href=\'https://profiles.wordpress.org/marybaum/\' class=\'mention\'><span class=\'mentions-prefix\'>@</span>marybaum</a>), Chloé Bringmann (<a href=\'https://profiles.wordpress.org/cbringmann/\' class=\'mention\'><span class=\'mentions-prefix\'>@</span>cbringmann</a>), and Meg Phillips (<a href=\'https://profiles.wordpress.org/megphillips91/\' class=\'mention\'><span class=\'mentions-prefix\'>@</span>megphillips91</a>) for interviews, writing and image work on this story.

And welcome to the WordPress Briefing. The podcast where you can catch quick explanations of the ideas behind the WordPress open source project, some insight into the community that supports it, and get a small list of big things coming up in the next two weeks. I&#8217;m your host, Josepha Haden Chomphosy.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Here we go.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Josepha Haden Chomphosy [00:00:39] </strong>&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>All right. So you&#8217;ve been listening to this podcast for a while. You may be one of these contributors I keep mentioning; you may be an agency owner or freelancer. Maybe you&#8217;ve wondered how to make a WordPress blog for your big idea. Or, maybe you&#8217;re one of the many people who use WordPress for their project or business. Before WordPress was known as a content management system, as a way to get sites online fast, it was a blogging tool.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>We have long since outgrown that, but even 19 years into our journey, blogging is still a key part of what WordPress enables you to do. That&#8217;s because even after those 19 years, the mission of WordPress is still the same. And that is to democratize publishing, to help people have a place online where they can tell their stories or share their projects or set up their businesses.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>If you&#8217;ve ever tried to set up a blog, you know that there isn&#8217;t a lot of information about what to know before you get going at all. So I&#8217;m going to talk about that a little bit today. And just by the way, if you heard the word blog right now and thought, oh, Josepha, how old fashioned? I think it&#8217;s important to remember that there&#8217;s a business advantage to having well-written, relevant content on your website.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Josepha Haden Chomphosy [00:01:59]</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>And if you&#8217;re not blogging for business, because not all of us are, then the benefits are a little different but still important to my mind. Things like the cathartic benefits of journaling, a chance to build community, and the general importance of preserving wisdom for the ages. Anyway, back to the topic at hand. Before we can get to any of the fancy things that WordPress can do nowadays, it&#8217;s important to know a few things as you get ready to set up your first ever website.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>So let&#8217;s dive in. Here is how you need to get yourself started. First, have an idea and a plan. So have an idea for what you&#8217;re doing, the concept of your content, who you want to reach, and some concept of a domain name. I would encourage you to not necessarily get your heart set on a domain name at first. Cause, like, if you want the domain name, wordpress.org, like we own that, you can have that! But if you know that you want a domain like WordPressbloggingforthefuture.com, like that one might be more available. And if you know the kind of words you want in your domain, you can be a bit flexible about what is there.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Josepha Haden Chomphosy [00:03:09]</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>The second thing that you need to do is that if you are just getting started, ask yourself the question, what sort of host do I want? We kind of mentioned all along the WordPress process that, like, you need a good host, but it’s not always clear where that decision has to happen. It happens right here at the start, before you even know what WordPress is most of the time.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>So, the earliest question that you have to answer for yourself is what sort of host do I want? Where do I want my site to live? So ask yourself how much you want to get into the maintenance and configuration of your website and the hardware that it lives on versus creating content or keeping your shop up to date.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>There&#8217;s this whole spectrum of hosting options, and they range from full service where they will keep your WordPress software up to date, provide daily backups, and have customer support if something goes really wrong. So it ranges all the way from full service like that all the way down to essentially zero services, just kind of hands-off.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Josepha Haden Chomphosy [00:04:11]&nbsp;</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>They give you a space to keep your WordPress software, to keep your WordPress site. But they leave everything else up to you. They leave the backups up to you. They leave updating up to you, things like. So that&#8217;s the first thing you have to ask yourself. And the first question you have to be able to answer. Most of the time, you will want to start with one of the full-service options. That way, you know that your software is set up correctly and safely from the start. And as you learn more about the software and what you want and what you need, and you have the ability to learn in the time that you have, the more that you can add on either service with the existing hosts that you chose or moving to a different host; however that works out for you.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>So if that one sounds like the right option, then you choose a host, go to their site, and actually most of them will have a way to walk you through how to set up a WordPress site inside their system. Most of the time, it&#8217;s just one click and then they ask you some questions to get some configurations right.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Josepha Haden Chomphosy [00:05:10]&nbsp;</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>The other option that on the like zero, zero service side, that&#8217;s not quite fair, but you know, the other side of that spectrum that probably will be appealing to you if you are already familiar with code or already know how to manage a server or, or you know how to work in this thing called c-panel, et cetera.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>So if you already have a lot of information on how all of that works, you can, if you want to, head over to wordpress.org/download, and you can download a zip file of the WordPress software and set that up in your own environment.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Okay, quick check here. If this all sounds roughly doable to you, or at least it feels like we&#8217;re in the right starting point, but you find yourself thinking, gosh, I just wish she would slow down a little.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>I&#8217;ve got you covered. In the show notes, you&#8217;ll find a link to one of the Learn WP courses for getting started with WordPress. There&#8217;s a section on choosing a host as well as various other early steps of this process. So if you felt like I blazed through all of that, which honestly I kind of did, you can work through those lessons in that course, at your own pace, and it&#8217;s, and it&#8217;s really a very good guide.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Josepha Haden Chomphosy [00:06:24]&nbsp;</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>All right. Let&#8217;s pretend we did all of that. Now you&#8217;ve got yourself a website. The thing that you will want to do next, or rather the first thing that you&#8217;ll notice once you get your site up and running, is that there&#8217;s this ‘Hello World’ post– there&#8217;s a post that already exists in there. The Hello World post is a placeholder for the common features of a blog post.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>There, you can find your featured image, your title, your content, and even some fake comments. You can either edit this post so that you can see how your writing will look from the start, and you can kind of compare like, okay, the Hello World part over here on this page, exists in this field over here on this page. So you can kind of see where everything works, how it all looks together. Or, if you&#8217;re more familiar with WordPress or CMS in general, you can simply remove that and start fresh.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Josepha Haden Chomphosy [00:07:17]</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>So we&#8217;ve got now a website, we know, kind of, how to look at our posts and create posts, where comments are, where they can kind of be moderated and stuff. And so, the most fun task for everyone is choosing a theme. But if it&#8217;s not a fun task, if it doesn&#8217;t sound like a fun task to you, I can help you kind of do some, choose your own adventure guiding questions here.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Firstly, you can ask yourself how you want the site to look. Do you want it to mostly be a lot of photos or entirely words, mostly animations? You can head to the theme directory and search for a theme with most of the features that you want. There&#8217;s like a filtering system where you can put in, like, you want three columns so that you can have three columns of text if you want it to look kind of like an old school newspaper kind of layout and things like.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Josepha Haden Chomphosy [00:08:12]</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>There&#8217;s also a way to look for themes inside your instance, your WordPress site, but like, if you haven&#8217;t set that up yet, but you do still want to see kind of what your theme options are, you can go to wordpress.org/themes and and take a look at what&#8217;s out there. Just as a quick side note, if you get to that theme directory, if you get to wordpress.org/themes, and it feels overwhelming, which I can understand, I recommend starting with a theme that is designed for blogging specifically so that you can see how things look right away.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And there&#8217;s actually a theme that does come with every WordPress site. So if you&#8217;re not ready, you can skip this thing entirely and just work with the theme that&#8217;s already there. Every word, press instance ships with a theme and it is fully functional when you, when you get your site up and running. So you don&#8217;t need to choose a theme right now if you don&#8217;t feel ready.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And then the other very fun thing that people do with their WordPress sites is to add plugins to them. So plugins are these little pieces of software that you add on to the WordPress software that lets it do additional things. It adds additional functionality. The questions that you can ask to kind of guide yourself through what sorts of plugins you might want, what sorts of functionality you might want to add to your site are a little similar to the ones that you want to ask for figuring out which theme.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Josepha Haden Chomphosy [00:09:36]</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>So figure out if there are tasks that you need visitors to do. Do you need them to contact you? Do you want them to watch a video? Should they review and respond to questions?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>If you have a concept of the things that you want users to do on your website, then you can head to the plugin directory and search for a plugin with features that you need. Also, there are just endless lists of recommended plugins out there; if that is something that you find valuable as part of your research, those are also easy to find.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And as a general side note here, there are even more plugins than there are themes. So if you have gotten to this point and feel like you don&#8217;t quite know the answers to the questions that I shared, and, and it&#8217;s going to be a while until you feel like you can know what those answers are. That&#8217;s totally fine.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>I&#8217;ll tell you this. I have never seen a site without a contact form. So feel free to begin your journey there. There are a lot of great plugins for contact forms and it can kind of help you figure out how to work with plugins in that way. So yeah, I made it sound like you can get a WordPress website built in like seven minutes and on the one hand you definitely can.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Josepha Haden Chomphosy [00:09:36]</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>And on the other hand, it&#8217;s still a little bit more complicated. So here I have a final note for everyone. You will hear around the WordPress ecosystem. And obviously, here, are some things that could make you feel a little nervous about doing this for the first time. Things like the five-second installation, which WordPress has been famous for years.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>But also about how easy and simple it all is. And as somebody who was once in the position of learning WordPress for the first time, like I first encountered a WordPress site in 2009 and I started learning how to use WordPress in 2010. So I can say with confidence that once you learn it, it&#8217;s easy.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>We are the easiest of the hard options for CMS. Like content management systems are just complicated, but we are the easiest one out there. And so, as you&#8217;re learning, I want to just remind you to celebrate your small wins along the way. If you feel like you&#8217;re late to this blogging game, like you should have had a website for years. I mean, sure that could be true. And yes, the best time to plant a tree was 20 years ago. But the second-best time to plant that tree is today.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>WordPress didn&#8217;t start out powering over 40% of the web, and your first site can&#8217;t be immediately measured in the millions of readers. So, what will your small beginning lead you to?&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Josepha Haden Chomphosy [00:12:25]</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>And now that brings us to our small list of big things.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The first one, the next release of WordPress, WordPress 6.0, has reached its beta phase. That means the full focus is on finding and fixing the bugs we accidentally created during this development cycle. Beta two comes out tomorrow and you can follow along in the core channel in the Making WordPress Slack.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>If you&#8217;ve never seen how those releases get packaged, and if you just want to keep an eye on what everybody&#8217;s doing so that you can be the first to know, yeah, Making WordPress Slack is the way to go.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The second thing on our small list is that speaking of WordPress 6.0, we had the public walk through a couple of weeks ago, which means that in a few weeks, I&#8217;ll do a WordPress 6.0 sneak peek. I&#8217;ll share some highlights of the release features and why I think they are super important for you to take a look. Sooner rather than later.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Josepha Haden Chomphosy [00:13:22]</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>And then the final, big thing, if you are new to WordPress and this episode has you all fired up to start your blog, we have a bunch of contributors over on the Learn WP team that have just the thing for you.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>You can join the online social learning space called How to Make a WordPress Blog. It&#8217;s a free online event that will help you get started. I&#8217;ll link the information in the show notes below. And I&#8217;ll also share in the show notes, a list of WordPress Meetup groups, where you can find more opportunities to learn and get support from other people locally who are also doing things with WordPress.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>But you can also find a list in the dashboard of your newly installed WordPress blog you no doubt have after this podcast.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And that my friends is your small list of big things. Thank you for tuning in today for the WordPress Briefing. I&#8217;m your host Josepha Haden Chomphosy, and I&#8217;ll see you again in a couple of weeks.</p>\n\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}s:30:\"com-wordpress:feed-additions:1\";a:1:{s:7:\"post-id\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:5:\"12658\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}}}i:11;a:6:{s:4:\"data\";s:63:\"\n		\n		\n		\n		\n		\n				\n		\n		\n		\n\n					\n										\n					\n		\n		\n			\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";s:5:\"child\";a:4:{s:0:\"\";a:6:{s:5:\"title\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:20:\"WordPress 6.0 Beta 1\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"link\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:56:\"https://wordpress.org/news/2022/04/wordpress-6-0-beta-1/\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:7:\"pubDate\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:31:\"Tue, 12 Apr 2022 19:08:59 +0000\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:8:\"category\";a:3:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:11:\"Development\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}i:1;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:8:\"Releases\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}i:2;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:3:\"6.0\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"guid\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:35:\"https://wordpress.org/news/?p=12644\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:1:{s:0:\"\";a:1:{s:11:\"isPermaLink\";s:5:\"false\";}}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:11:\"description\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:63:\"WordPress 6.0 Beta 1 is now available for download and testing.\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}s:32:\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\";a:1:{s:7:\"creator\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:11:\"Dan Soschin\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}s:40:\"http://purl.org/rss/1.0/modules/content/\";a:1:{s:7:\"encoded\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:7809:\"\n<p>WordPress 6.0 Beta 1 is now available for download and testing.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>This version of the WordPress software is under development</strong>. Please do not install, run, and test this version of WordPress on a production or mission-critical website. Instead, it is recommended that you test Beta 1 on a test server and site.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>You can test the WordPress 6.0 Beta 1 in three ways:</p>\n\n\n\n<ul><li>Option 1: Install and activate the <a href=\"https://wordpress.org/plugins/wordpress-beta-tester/\">WordPress Beta Tester</a> plugin (select the “Bleeding edge” channel and “Beta/RC Only” stream).</li><li>Option 2: Direct download the <a href=\"https://wordpress.org/wordpress-6.0-beta1.zip\">beta version here (zip)</a>.</li><li>Option 3: Use WP-CLI to test: <code>wp core update --version=6.0-beta1</code>. <br><strong><em>Do not use this option if your filesystem is case-insensitive.</em></strong></li></ul>\n\n\n\n<p>The current target for the final release is May 24, 2022, which is about six weeks away.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Additional information on the full <a href=\"https://make.wordpress.org/core/6-0/\">6.0 release cycle is available</a>.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Check the <a href=\"https://make.wordpress.org/core/\">Make WordPress Core blog</a> for <a href=\"https://make.wordpress.org/core/tag/dev-notes+6-0/\">6.0-related developer notes</a> in the coming weeks which will detail all upcoming changes.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2><strong>Keep WordPress Bug Free – Help with Testing</strong></h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Testing for issues is critical for stabilizing a release throughout its development. Testing is also a great way to contribute. If you have never tested a beta release before, <a href=\"https://make.wordpress.org/test/2022/04/12/help-wanted-test-wordpress-6-0/\">this detailed guide</a> will walk you through how to get started.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Testing helps make sure that this and future releases of WordPress are as stable and issue-free as possible. And anyone can do it – especially great WordPress community members just like you.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Want to know more about testing releases like this one? Read about the <a href=\"https://make.wordpress.org/test/\">testing initiatives</a> that happen in Make Core. You can also join a <a href=\"https://wordpress.slack.com/messages/core-test/\">publicly-accessible channel</a> on the <a href=\"https://wordpress.slack.com\">Making WordPress Slack workspace</a>.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>If you think you have run into an issue, please report it to the <a href=\"https://wordpress.org/support/forum/alphabeta/\">Alpha/Beta area</a> in the support forums. If you are comfortable writing a reproducible bug report, you can <a href=\"https://core.trac.wordpress.org/newticket\">file one on WordPress Trac</a>.

And welcome to the WordPress Briefing: the podcast where you can catch quick explanations of the ideas behind the WordPress open source project, some insight into the community that supports it and get a small list of big things coming up in the next two weeks. I&#8217;m your host, Josepha Haden Chomphosy. Here we go.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Josepha Haden Chomphosy [00:00:40]&nbsp;</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>I was checking the list of upcoming events recently as part of just my regular work and saw that the call for organizers for WordCamp Asia is open. On the one hand, it made my heart skip a beat with excitement. That event is six years or so in the making. And on the other hand, it reminded me of February 10th, 2020, the day that Matt told me that we had to proactively cancel WordCamp Asia. That week was truly heartbreaking for me as well as I think the entire organizing team.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>But it also, fortunately, was prescient. As I think back over the two years since then, I&#8217;m grateful for our community wranglers and deputies who have consistently hosted important discussions about how to return to in-person events safely. And with two of our major flagship events returning this year, I&#8217;m here to summarize, sort of, what the rules and guidelines are.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>But certainly I hope that you come away from this with an idea of what&#8217;s being done to keep everyone safe as we are best able.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Josepha Haden Chomphosy [00:01:44]&nbsp;</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>Firstly, before we dig into specifics, I want to be clear upfront that the guidelines for COVID-aware events are mandatory, unless otherwise stated. For folks who&#8217;ve been attending WordPress events, or participating in the community for a long time, this is a change. As a program, we have always done our best to be flexible with guidelines so that we can prioritize local knowledge. But our responsibility is to the long-term success of this community and this program. So moving forward with in-person events that risk the health of our community members poses risks to the program itself. So with that in mind, let&#8217;s learn what we&#8217;re going to see at events for the rest of the.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Josepha Haden Chomphosy [00:02:28]&nbsp;</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>For any WordPress event that is gathering more than 50 people, the new mandatory guidelines are:</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Number one, follow local laws and guidelines. If your area has suggested guidelines on top of the mandatory ones, follow those.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Second, is if you are in a location where laws or guidelines require or permit venues to limit admission based on a person&#8217;s vaccination status and masking, then events can only happen in venues that are willing to provide staff to check for vaccination status at the door. And then also to remind participants to wear masks during the event.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And the third thing is if your area or venue legally cannot check vaccination status, your area must pass the in-person checklist, which I will link in the show notes below. But that in-person checklist has to be passed at the time of the application and then again at the time of the event. And in addition to that, the venue must be willing to provide staff who will remind participants to wear masks and check for temperature during the event.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Josepha Haden Chomphosy [00:03:33]&nbsp;</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>Organizers in these areas must be prepared to move online or cancel if the region fails the safety checklist, which again, will be linked in the show notes below. So those are the three things and they are pretty dense, but also I think allow for a fair amount of flexibility. There is also a tidy flow chart linked in the sidebar of make.wordpress.org/community that will help you to decide what sort of event your own area can support right now.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>So those are the mandatory guidelines for WordPress events in general right now, but you probably also have a few specific questions. So I&#8217;ve got the three most common questions ready to go with answers from Angela Jin who helped me to kind of pull together the information for this particular podcast props to Angela. Thank you.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Josepha Haden Chomphosy [00:04:25]&nbsp;</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>So, first question, anything specific to know about WordCamp Europe? WordCamp Europe will be following these guidelines as well. All attendees and participants are expected to wear a mask while they are at the event and catering will be offered outside so people can remove their masks to eat.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The second common question is how will these guidelines change as countries and local governments begin deescalating restrictions and safety measures? We should consider these guidelines to be subject to evolution based on what the team is hearing and seeing from the community. But right now we intend to keep these stricter guidelines in place until we see how the loosened rules play out elsewhere.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And then a third frequent question is what&#8217;s going to happen to all these online events?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The community team will continue to support online events right now. So if your community doesn&#8217;t feel ready to have an in-person event, but still wants to kind of get everyone together that is still allowed, and still&nbsp; encouraged. And finally the community team will continue to keep a close eye on situations around the world.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>If it becomes safe to do so, and your community is interested, they of course will be happy to chat with you about a WordCamp. There is an application that I will share the link to in the show notes below as well. In case that is something that your community is wanting to look into.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Josepha Haden Chomphosy [00:05:54]</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>Oh, and I have a little postscript also. I know I was like finally, and now I&#8217;m doing a finally, finally. That&#8217;s what postscripts are about. P.S. If you have not stopped by the community team’s site or any of their meetings, they&#8217;ve been doing a really great job of keeping things moving through two years of unpredictable changes. If you are a community team member, I want to offer you a huge thanks. Thank you so much for helping us to stay aware and able to move forward.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>If you are an organizer, pat yourself on the back. I want to thank you for pivoting with us, moving through online events, even though they are not at all the same as in-person events and certainly they don&#8217;t share the reasons that we get people together sometimes.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And finally, if you are an end to end attendee, if you go to WordPress meetups or you go to any sort of WordPress online events or WordCamps, anything like that, thank your local organizer. They have been doing this probably for a while, and I&#8217;m sure that they are looking forward to getting back to in-person events themselves, but even, so they have been putting in a lot of volunteer hours to help make sure that we all know how to use WordPress.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And so find them, thank them, and I&#8217;m sure that they&#8217;ll appreciate it.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Josepha Haden Chomphosy [00:07:20]</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>And with that, it is time for our small list of big things. Number one, WordCamp Asia has a call for organizers open! This event will be in 2023. And I think that we all simply cannot wait. So I&#8217;ll link the call for organizers in the show notes. And then of course you can follow that whole site to stay up to date on what&#8217;s happening there.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The second thing is, while we&#8217;re on the topic of events, there&#8217;s also an open discussion about how we can best support organizers who are getting back to in-person events. We&#8217;d like thoughts from both organizers and attendees. So feel free to drop by and leave a note in the comments section. And while you&#8217;re over there, the third thing in my small list of big things, there&#8217;s also an open discussion about regional events. So go over there, get all your thoughts about WordPress events together. Get them all sorted out in one go. Just leave comments, boom, boom, boom, boom, boom. All over the place.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And that my friends is your small list of big things. Thank you for tuning in today for the WordPress Briefing. I&#8217;m your host Josepha Haden Chomphosy.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And I&#8217;ll see you again in a couple of weeks.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Josepha Haden Chomphosy [00:08:54]</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>So my most embarrassing WordCamp story actually has to do with where I was supposed to be versus where people thought I was supposed to be. This was early on in my time with WordPress, with Automattic. And I had convinced someone, I had convinced a colleague and friend of mine to go to my home WordCamp, WordCamp Fayetteville over there in Arkansas.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And then I didn&#8217;t go. But I knew I wasn&#8217;t going, I knew I was going to WordCamp Boston, but he did not know that I was not going to go. And so he arrived at WordCamp Fayetteville, WordCamp Northwest Arkansas. I can&#8217;t remember what it was called at the time. And immediately was confused about where I was and why I wasn&#8217;t there.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And so there was this excellent moment of mass confusion among states where the folks at WordCamp Fayetteville started tweeting about how I had convinced this contributor to go to that event and then didn&#8217;t show up. And then the folks at WordCamp Boston, we&#8217;re looking at all of those tweets, because if you are a WordCamp organizer, you are always looking at the tweets from all the other WordCamps happening in your weekend.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And people got very confused about why I was in Boston while they were thinking that I was in Fayetteville, even though the tweets were talking about how, like, I wasn&#8217;t in Fayetteville. They probably didn&#8217;t say that it was probably more along the lines of like, “Hey, let&#8217;s share a photo with Josepha” to, like, make fun of the fact that I wasn&#8217;t there.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And so I caused mass confusion in multiple states.

For Juan Aldasoro, a developer and product manager for a large distributed company, it provides an opportunity to combine his different interests and skills to live the type of life he wanted.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>“I like visual, creative and technical things. The joy of WordPress is that you can do all of these things, you don’t have to limit yourself to any one aspect . You can also do this from almost anywhere in the world!”</p>\n\n\n\n<p>From working in products since 2012, Juan sees WordPress as a major part of his skillset and toolbox. He said: “It gives you an opportunity to be part of building a product which could potentially be used by thousands of people and more on your site. It encourages you to think about different languages and how you can make it accessible. It allows you to work on different platforms. Working in WordPress gives you this broad approach. Working this way on products ended up pushing me into learning about all these different things. Only in open source can you really do this and use your creative side to find solutions.”</p>\n\n\n\n<h2><strong>Learning about being part of a community</strong></h2>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"1024\" height=\"924\" src=\"https://i0.wp.com/wordpress.org/news/files/2022/03/Juanfra_2813.jpeg?resize=1024%2C924&#038;ssl=1\" alt=\"Juan standing in a astreet with murals behind him\" class=\"wp-image-12529\" srcset=\"https://i0.wp.com/wordpress.org/news/files/2022/03/Juanfra_2813-scaled.jpeg?resize=1024%2C924&amp;ssl=1 1024w, https://i0.wp.com/wordpress.org/news/files/2022/03/Juanfra_2813-scaled.jpeg?resize=300%2C271&amp;ssl=1 300w, https://i0.wp.com/wordpress.org/news/files/2022/03/Juanfra_2813-scaled.jpeg?resize=768%2C693&amp;ssl=1 768w, https://i0.wp.com/wordpress.org/news/files/2022/03/Juanfra_2813-scaled.jpeg?resize=1536%2C1386&amp;ssl=1 1536w, https://i0.wp.com/wordpress.org/news/files/2022/03/Juanfra_2813-scaled.jpeg?resize=2048%2C1847&amp;ssl=1 2048w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\" /></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>Born in a mid-sized city in Argentina, Juan was raised in a family in which music, arts and sports were always an essential part of everyday life.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>“These activities encourage human beings to be creative and participative, and at the same time they are highly formative when it comes to mould people in order to become part of a group, a team, a community.”</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The youngest of five siblings, Juan became highly motivated, trying to follow the steps of his siblings. Having a computer at home, he started to make connections that laid the foundation for his career as a developer. His interest in computers grew through that access to a machine running MS-DOS &#8211; the one with the black screen command line! Mastering this became a challenge to him and something to share with others. Through doing this, he found a way to more social interaction and new friendships.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<blockquote class=\"wp-block-quote\"><p>Without being conscious of it, my friends and I were sharing pieces of code.</p></blockquote>\n\n\n\n<p>He said: “I started learning some super easy stuff that made me feel like Houdini at that time. I could save a game play, something intangible, on a floppy disk and carry that piece of plastic and magnetic material back home. I was saving the play or game in a square object and then loading that back at home. I now realize, those were my first interactions with computer commands. Without being conscious of it, my friends and I were sharing pieces of code in a unique way.”</p>\n\n\n\n<p>This interest grew further through computer magazines and experimenting as &#8220;there was always something new to learn.” Although sport became a big part of Juan’s life in his teens, he kept up his computer learning. Taking a new direction, he found online tutorials enabling him to learn how to play the guitar. This led to setting up a punk rock band with his friends.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>“Education has always been important in my family, and thanks to my parent’s efforts, I attended a school where I learned to express myself in another language.” The school had hired a satellite internet connection in the mid-nineties and had HTML on the computer studies program. These facilities were not that common in Argentina or many other countries either at that time. Also, his parents had the foresight to secure a rare internet connection at the house in 1997. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Juan recalled: “Browsing around the Internet opened a new universe in my mind. This new universe was extremely fantastic but also extremely expensive. I needed to make the most of every second online.”<br><br>“It was a whole new world and one thing led to the other. I started learning a bit of everything, editing graphics, scripting and so on. I still remember my first website in the fantastic sunset strip, Geocities.”</p>\n\n\n\n<h3><strong>Trying to go pro</strong></h3>\n\n\n\n<p>After high school, Juan moved to the city along with his brother and began to study IT at University. When he was asked by a friend to work at a software company, he decided to try that whilst continuing his studies. Through his job he had the chance to explore web-related opportunities, and with a friend from university, they started managing teams and projects across Latin America and Spain.<br><br>Juan describes this experience as one of the most fulfilling in his life. He was able to travel abroad for work, experience remote working, manage teams, present projects and speak formally in front of senior people. As the company grew at a fast pace, they learned how to set up and run a large organization. Eventually, he decided to drop out of his university program and focus on the opportunity of learning first hand.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-full\"><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"600\" height=\"600\" src=\"https://i0.wp.com/wordpress.org/news/files/2022/03/juanfra.jpg?resize=600%2C600&#038;ssl=1\" alt=\"Juan riding a bicycle in a historical city during his travels\" class=\"wp-image-12509\" srcset=\"https://i0.wp.com/wordpress.org/news/files/2022/03/juanfra.jpg?w=600&amp;ssl=1 600w, https://i0.wp.com/wordpress.org/news/files/2022/03/juanfra.jpg?resize=300%2C300&amp;ssl=1 300w, https://i0.wp.com/wordpress.org/news/files/2022/03/juanfra.jpg?resize=150%2C150&amp;ssl=1 150w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 600px) 100vw, 600px\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\" /></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>One of the key early learning from working internationally was that business and web development could be just as fast-moving and successful in Argentina as in other places. “I realized there’s no such thing as a secret sauce for success. Projects are backed by people’s talent and time, and you can find that in any latitude.”<br><br>By his mid-20s, Juan decided he wanted to try building something from scratch. He created a social network for photo sharing in Latin America, which was used by more than 30,000 people across Latin America and Spain in its time. Through this, he discovered that other people had a blog and he did not want to be left behind. The discovery of WordPress was to change the focus of his life.<br></p>\n\n\n\n<h2>Hello to WordPress</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Spending some time traveling around Europe, Juan found himself ‘surrounded by uncertainty’ and worried about what the future could bring. “I had some clues, but under uncertainty, the more you ask the less you answer. I started thinking about embracing the following philosophy: I didn’t want to be part of a large company, I didn’t want to continue studying and I wanted to travel as much as I could.” He did not realize at that time how this vision for his life was to mirror what he would find in WordPress.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>He started using WordPress for a few sites in 2005. By 2007 he was using it for almost everything. He was struck by the magnitude and range of what the software could do, from a simple tool used to create a blog in the blink of an eye through to complex projects.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>His first problem-solving project was simple and saved data received through a contact form plugin. “To complete this project I discovered the Codex and I learned how easy and intuitive it is to create a plugin. I had fallen in love with WordPress.”</p>\n\n\n\n<blockquote class=\"wp-block-quote\"><p>I was truly amazed by how I could learn from others.</p></blockquote>\n\n\n\n<p>As he explored the options with the software, Juan was unsure of how intellectual property worked and wanted to be respectful of other people’s work. “I didn’t understand open source yet, and I wasn’t sure if I was stealing from others. That was my first interaction with GPL and open source. I was truly amazed by how I could learn from others and improve things created by others or by myself.”</p>\n\n\n\n<p>He realized: “WordPress was the way to go if I wanted to pursue a dream of traveling, skipping winter, and working at the same time; what we now call a digital nomad. I already knew how to work remotely, I could work for companies located anywhere, as long as they could communicate in English or Spanish.”</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Juan started his own web agency, where he provided services to small and medium-sized companies abroad in the USA, UK, and Australia. He built his reputation and developed strong relationships in WordPress. “The experience couldn’t be better. I was learning, having fun, making a living out of it, and at the same time exploring the world.”</p>\n\n\n\n<p>In mid-2012, he discovered the full power of the WordPress community firsthand. In his spare time he started developing themes and from all he heard, wanted to attend a major event with lots of others in WordPress, a WordCamp. He took the plunge and booked for WordCamp in Edinburgh, in the UK. He said: “I got to meet many super talented people, and the atmosphere of the event was awesome. A place where competitors were also colleagues. Seeing the humility of somebody like Mike Little, the co-founder of WordPress, was amazing.”</p>\n\n\n\n<p>He added: “While there, unconsciously, I started dreaming of holding something like that in Argentina &#8211; the joy of hosting the WordPress community in my home country.”</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Back home, while browsing the Codex, he happened to see that WordPress was turning 10. A lot of meetups were going to be organized worldwide to celebrate the birthday. But there was nothing organized in Argentina. This was a catalyst for starting a local meetup. Together with a colleague, he&nbsp; organized an Argentinian 10th birthday meetup. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>More than 20 people showed up. “There was a common denominator. We all loved WordPress, it was part of our day-to-day life. We wanted to share experiences, make new friends and continue growing from what we could learn from others. That day we were a group of people with shared interests. That’s the simplest way to define a community, isn’t it?” This early meetup led to the formation of what is now called <a href=\"http://wpargentina.org/\">WordPress Argentina</a>.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>In his desire to skip winters and do more traveling, his next adventure was to take him to visit family working in the US and attend one of the biggest WordCamps in the world in San Francisco. His interest kept growing and he traveled across Europe to be part of the first edition of WordCamp Europe in the Netherlands in 2013.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>He said: “There’s almost nothing I could write to fully express what you experience in such events. They are the main WordPress events worldwide. The best part: I made a lot of good friends from many different places. I’m glad I have more excuses to continue traveling.”</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Once again in Argentina, our organization started growing thanks to the energy of the whole group, we started hosting formal meetups. In May 2015, we crowned all these efforts with a new <a href=\"https://buenosaires.wordcamp.org/2015/\">WordCamp in Buenos Aires</a>, Argentina.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"1024\" height=\"683\" src=\"https://i0.wp.com/wordpress.org/news/files/2022/03/Juanfra-WCBA15-51.jpg?resize=1024%2C683&#038;ssl=1\" alt=\"Juan speaking at WordCamp Buenos Aires\" class=\"wp-image-12528\" srcset=\"https://i1.wp.com/wordpress.org/news/files/2022/03/Juanfra-WCBA15-51-scaled.jpg?resize=1024%2C683&amp;ssl=1 1024w, https://i1.wp.com/wordpress.org/news/files/2022/03/Juanfra-WCBA15-51-scaled.jpg?resize=300%2C200&amp;ssl=1 300w, https://i1.wp.com/wordpress.org/news/files/2022/03/Juanfra-WCBA15-51-scaled.jpg?resize=768%2C512&amp;ssl=1 768w, https://i1.wp.com/wordpress.org/news/files/2022/03/Juanfra-WCBA15-51-scaled.jpg?resize=1536%2C1024&amp;ssl=1 1536w, https://i1.wp.com/wordpress.org/news/files/2022/03/Juanfra-WCBA15-51-scaled.jpg?resize=2048%2C1365&amp;ssl=1 2048w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\" /></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>“Organizing such an event in my home country with many of the contributors I had met from the very first meetup was an experience I will always keep with me.”</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Juan believes one of his biggest contributions to open source was as part of being able to expand the community in Argentina and to share this with other Latin American and Spanish speaking countries. He also contributes as a volunteer translator in the Polyglots Team, to the Make WordPress Support team, and contributes to code blocks and Gutenberg. “I am really excited about seeing the future of Gutenberg as it is the future of WordPress.”</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Throughout his time contributing, Juan believes in helping to set the foundations and encouraging others to give their time and talents. He is keen to share that contributing does not have to be the same all the time and that you can have breaks and focus on one area in a particular period too. He gives the example of how in his spare time he watches Trac, where tickets about the software are logged, and looks where he might be able to help or think of solutions.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>He said: “Anytime I find I can contribute to or make improvements in code-related areas, I will do as it is important to keep giving to the community. I enjoy crawling over meta, trac, GitHub and the different places that are requesting help. There is always somewhere you can help. At the moment, my focus is code and translations. I always try to save time to help these two areas. It is like you give and you get, you learn things. You meet amazing people and opportunities arrive.”</p>\n\n\n\n<h2>Finding your path in WordPress</h2>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"768\" height=\"1024\" src=\"https://i1.wp.com/wordpress.org/news/files/2022/03/Juanfra_1505.jpeg?resize=768%2C1024&#038;ssl=1\" alt=\"Juan sat in a street cafe surrounded by parked motorcycles\" class=\"wp-image-12527\" srcset=\"https://i2.wp.com/wordpress.org/news/files/2022/03/Juanfra_1505-scaled.jpeg?resize=768%2C1024&amp;ssl=1 768w, https://i2.wp.com/wordpress.org/news/files/2022/03/Juanfra_1505-scaled.jpeg?resize=225%2C300&amp;ssl=1 225w, https://i2.wp.com/wordpress.org/news/files/2022/03/Juanfra_1505-scaled.jpeg?resize=1152%2C1536&amp;ssl=1 1152w, https://i2.wp.com/wordpress.org/news/files/2022/03/Juanfra_1505-scaled.jpeg?resize=1536%2C2048&amp;ssl=1 1536w, https://i2.wp.com/wordpress.org/news/files/2022/03/Juanfra_1505-scaled.jpeg?w=1920&amp;ssl=1 1920w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 768px) 100vw, 768px\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\" /></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>“Life is about experiences, it is about the people you surround yourself with and trying to do what you love.

I&#8217;m your host, Josepha Haden Chomphosy. Here we go!</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Today, we&#8217;re talking about who WordPress is built for. I was talking to a group of contributors last week and we encountered some questions around just who WordPress is built for. And it&#8217;s a question that you&#8217;ll find any time that you&#8217;re working on user testing or on triaging tickets, and especially when that comes up when you look at the big picture, roadmap sorts of things. The easiest answer for this question is, of course, everyone because WordPress&#8217; mission is to democratize publishing and that should be available to everyone.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Josepha Haden Chomphosy </strong><strong>[00:01:11]</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>However, everyone is a really big target and certainly doesn&#8217;t help get your mind around the people that you&#8217;re wanting to actually build it for, the people that you actually want to be able to use your product, your software on a day-to-day basis. So let&#8217;s take a look at the one question that can help us figure out who it&#8217;s built for today and how we get it to being something that&#8217;s built forever.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Firstly, there&#8217;s a basic premise of open source that informs this thought. And that premise is that we are citizens of a community of contributors therefore the decisions are made by the people who show up. In general, I believe that to be true, though, I also believe that some basic qualifications are needed.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Josepha Haden Chomphosy [00:01:50]&nbsp;</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>So with that in mind, the one question that can help us figure out who a software is built for is this: how do your active contributors see themselves? I would bet that most contributors to open source software projects, like WordPress, are developers of some sort, it is sort of written right into the definition of the project.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>If you work on software, then you need developers. And what I love about WordPress, in particular, is that we do work to include contributors who are not developers. Yet it still remains true that there is a fairly high level of technical knowledge required to actively contribute.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Josepha Haden Chomphosy [00:2:25]&nbsp;</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>Which kind of brings us to the second half of the original question of how can we make sure that WordPress can be something that&#8217;s built for everyone? The answer to this one is easy to say, hard to do, and that is to make sure to include them as co-creators in the development process.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>We&#8217;ve talked about co-creators in open source before. It&#8217;s this idea that people who use the software every day are likely to know the biggest pain points. So if you want your software to be used by people who don&#8217;t know HTML, talk to a bunch of people who don&#8217;t know HTML about how it is to use your software.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>If you want your software to be mostly used by enterprise agencies, talk to enterprise agencies, but also ask them what their clients hate, because everyone has more than one stakeholder. And I know that I said this already, but it bears repeating that, obviously, this is all very easy to say and hard to do.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Josepha Haden Chomphosy [00:3:20]&nbsp;</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>So what is my best guess for the how-to-do part for WordPress? There are three things.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The first is testing. This not only helps bring in new contributors and helps train future contributors, which I&#8217;ve talked about on the podcast before. But testing also gives us a higher chance of actionable feedback from folks who don&#8217;t necessarily spend time directly in the WordPress project.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Frequently the feedback that we do get that is just kind of undirected and ad hoc is exactly that– it is undirected and ad hoc and is then hard to follow up on and make sure that we understand what was wrong and how we can help fix it. And so testing is important for that. And testing it turns out is important for a bunch of things. When you&#8217;re working in open source.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The next thing is support. So checking in with support teams at hosts, as well as the hardworking support teams in the project. And that can really help us to get early indications of what difficulties exist now. They have routinely seen problems and issues that are raised in support forums, and from their everyday users that they are providing support to.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>That probably could be fixed in WordPress if we had a good understanding of just what was not going right, how many people really needed it to go better, and what our targets were to fix that particular problem.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Josepha Haden Chomphosy [00:4:45]&nbsp;</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>And the third thing is communication. I know that I&#8217;ve gone on record in many places as saying that most of our problems at the end of the day are communication problems. And I&#8217;m going on record about it again here in this podcast, establishing better communication patterns with users is key.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>That can be a multi-year project in itself. And even after that, it&#8217;s going to be an ongoing journey. But it is one of the many things that WordCamps and other WordPress events have given to us over the years, an opportunity to really hear from and see the struggles that people who are not building with WordPress every day, or literally building WordPress every day are actually having.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Josepha Haden Chomphosy [00:5:34]&nbsp;</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>So now that you&#8217;ve heard my small list of way too big things, that brings us to our regular small list of big things. The first thing is that WordCamp Europe is still looking for volunteers. If you&#8217;ve never done that before, I think it&#8217;s quite fun. You get to meet a lot of people and the team of organizers is super fun, but I&#8217;ll leave a link for you in the show notes.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>We also have a new code-free way to contribute through the photo directory. That team is just getting started and still is working toward building out its programs. So now&#8217;s a good time to drop in and just kind of see what they are up to. And finally, a reminder that we do have contributors who are affected by the war in Ukraine right now. I will reshare the list of humanitarian organizations in case you missed them a couple of weeks ago as well.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Josepha Haden Chomphosy [00:6:21]&nbsp;</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>And that my friends is your small list of big things. Thank you for tuning in today for this WordPress Briefing. I&#8217;m your host, Josepha Haden Chomphosy. I&#8217;ll see you again in a couple of weeks.</p>\n\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}s:30:\"com-wordpress:feed-additions:1\";a:1:{s:7:\"post-id\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:5:\"12451\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}}}i:18;a:6:{s:4:\"data\";s:63:\"\n		\n		\n		\n		\n		\n				\n		\n		\n		\n\n					\n										\n					\n		\n		\n			\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";s:5:\"child\";a:4:{s:0:\"\";a:6:{s:5:\"title\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:48:\"WordPress 5.9.2 Security and Maintenance Release\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"link\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:80:\"https://wordpress.org/news/2022/03/wordpress-5-9-2-security-maintenance-release/\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:7:\"pubDate\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:31:\"Fri, 11 Mar 2022 02:24:13 +0000\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:8:\"category\";a:3:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:8:\"Releases\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}i:1;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:8:\"Security\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}i:2;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:3:\"5.9\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"guid\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:35:\"https://wordpress.org/news/?p=12421\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:1:{s:0:\"\";a:1:{s:11:\"isPermaLink\";s:5:\"false\";}}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:11:\"description\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:367:\"WordPress 5.9.2&#160;is now available!

I have Matt here with me today because we want to acknowledge that we are once again at the start of a very difficult time. Neither of us would presume to know what it&#8217;s like to be at the heart of such massive disruption in our lives. But who would we be if we didn&#8217;t stop and check in with you all, the project that we hold so dear? And with that, I&#8217;ll hand it right over to you, Matt.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Matt Mullenweg&nbsp; </strong>00:27</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Hello everyone. First, I want to thank Josepha for inviting me to join the WordPress Briefing to share what’s been on my mind in light of recent global events.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Matt Mullenweg&nbsp; </strong>00:37</p>\n\n\n\n<p>I&#8217;ve been listening and watching events escalate in Ukraine, often in a state of shock. The scale alone is hard to take in. I mean, in the last 7 days, more than 500,000 people have fled their homes, more refugees are expected every day. The downstream humanitarian crises of the invasion are unimaginable.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Matt Mullenweg&nbsp; </strong>00:56</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And seeing destruction in the world we live in is confusing, disconcerting, and difficult. In my experience, open source and WordPress bring people together; people from other countries and cultures, people that we know as friends and colleagues. Technology connects us, regardless of where we are. Nothing can negate the bad things happening in the world, but when I see how this community of contributors collaborates, regardless of borders, you all remind me of the good in the world every day.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Matt Mullenweg&nbsp; </strong>01:30</p>\n\n\n\n<p>I firmly believe that the web can be an equalizer and a force for good in the world. To me, the WordPress project is the epitome of goodness—everyone has a voice, a platform, and a community. You have the power to make your corner of the world, and the web, a sanctuary for those who need it—especially now.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Matt Mullenweg&nbsp; </strong>01:45</p>\n\n\n\n<p>If you or someone you know is affected by this war, I encourage you to be present as the ramifications unfold. While we may all feel fatigued and have a sense of languishing from the past two years of the Covid pandemic, the gift of time and support for one another cannot be overstated. I&#8217;m confident that every single person in the WordPress community will approach the situation in Ukraine with sensitivity and understanding.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Matt Mullenweg&nbsp; </strong>02:07</p>\n\n\n\n<p>I invite you to join me in standing with those in the world working to end conflict and working toward a world of peace, promise, and opportunity. If you&#8217;re looking for a way to help support the humanitarian crisis in Ukraine, I will offer some suggested NGOs, or Non-Governmental Organizations, that provide assistance to local peacebuilders in the region.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Matt Mullenweg&nbsp; </strong>02:26</p>\n\n\n\n<p>In closing, please know that my thoughts are with everyone in our community. I know that my words here can’t change anything there, but I hope that we all remember that words of support are never unwelcome. And we can never know when a little human kindness can help someone share the invisible heaviness in their heart.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Josepha Haden Chomphosy&nbsp; </strong>02:44</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Thanks for that, Matt.

In 2007, Tonya started to face health challenges that had an impact on all that she had known.</p>\n\n\n\n<blockquote class=\"wp-block-quote\"><p><strong>“My career defined me. It was my canvas and my art. When it was gone, I did not recognize myself.</strong></p><cite>Tonya Mork</cite></blockquote>\n\n\n\n<p>One day, she woke up at home ready to visit a client’s facility where her firm was building a robotic system. She said: “As I headed for the door, I fell to my knees, as this wave of pain crushed down on my chest.”</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Doctors diagnosed her with a very rare heart disease that caused her blood vessels to spasm, cutting off blood to whatever was downstream of the blockage. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>A few months later, she was diagnosed with a second rare and more serious condition, related to the migraines from which she had been suffering. Combined with her heart condition, this made every migraine attack life-threatening.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>For nearly seven years, the unexpected changes to her health left her mostly homebound and constantly monitored. This meant she had to close her engineering firm and say goodbye to staff and clients. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>“My career defined me. It was my canvas and my art. When it was gone, I was lost. I didn’t recognize myself.”</p>\n\n\n\n<p>But in her darkest hour, she found her strength. Tonya made a choice to move forward, and make the most of her life.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>“When you are at rock bottom, you have to make a decision or else it will consume you. My decision was that I chose to be happy,” said Tonya.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>One of Tonya’s first steps was to start writing a blog using WordPress. In this she shared insights on how to find peace and joy in any situation. She wrote about kindness and helping one another.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The joy of making solutions through WordPress became a way for Tonya to accept her new life and not feel as limited by her health. She wanted purpose, and in WordPress, she found just that.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Tonya felt she could do something worthwhile in the virtual world.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 id=\"a-ray-of-hope-for-tonya\">A ray of hope for Tonya</h2>\n\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-image\"><figure class=\"aligncenter size-full\"><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"1000\" height=\"750\" src=\"https://i1.wp.com/wordpress.org/news/files/2022/02/tonya.jpg?resize=1000%2C750&#038;ssl=1\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-12327\" srcset=\"https://i1.wp.com/wordpress.org/news/files/2022/02/tonya.jpg?w=1000&amp;ssl=1 1000w, https://i1.wp.com/wordpress.org/news/files/2022/02/tonya.jpg?resize=300%2C225&amp;ssl=1 300w, https://i1.wp.com/wordpress.org/news/files/2022/02/tonya.jpg?resize=768%2C576&amp;ssl=1 768w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\" /></figure></div>\n\n\n\n<p>In 2013, Tonya’s health deteriorated further. She was admitted into intensive care and was diagnosed with a third rare disease, this time related to her autoimmunity. She was not expected to survive this time. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Following what she describes as a ‘miraculous recovery,’ she became stronger and was able to stop relying on a wheelchair. She used the energy from working on websites to keep going. “WordPress kept my mind alive,” said Tonya.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>She had first used WordPress for her engineering firm’s intranet. But when she discovered the software’s full potential and the collaborative opportunities of open source, it opened a new world.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-pullquote\"><blockquote><p>&#8220;Finding WordPress helped me to find myself again&#8221;</p><cite>Tonya Mork</cite></blockquote></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>During the years which followed, she donated her time to build some WordPress websites and plugins. She said: “Through giving my time, I was able to do something other than sit in isolation.” </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Tonya was amazed by the sharing in open source in general and in WordPress in particular. She said: “I was amazed to see people sharing so much information freely with one another. In my former engineering world, information was proprietary. Throughout my career, I had worked to break down those silos and help anyone to understand complex systems. I was drawn to this open community.”&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>She also became aware that WordPress developers were hungry to learn more about development. She wanted to be part of the solution with her passion for teaching and the knowledge she had gained in industry.<br><br>She said: “Finding WordPress helped me to find myself again. Here in this community, I was able to feel like a person again, not a sick one, but a professional with something to give.”</p>\n\n\n\n<p>As her interest in the software grew, Tonya decided to start a non-profit where she turned to WordPress to build the websites. This re-sparked her interest in programming. She said: “I wanted to really know the code and understand what made it tick.”</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The realization led Tonya to start the WP Developers’ Club, which in turn spawned <a href=\"https://knowthecode.io/\">Know the Code</a>, to help educate individual developers, and is still used today.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 id=\"from-helping-wordpress-companies-to-working-on-wordpress-core\">From helping WordPress companies to working on WordPress Core</h2>\n\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-image\"><figure class=\"aligncenter size-full\"><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"300\" height=\"300\" src=\"https://i0.wp.com/wordpress.org/news/files/2022/02/tonya-with-dog.jpg?resize=300%2C300&#038;ssl=1\" alt=\"Tonya pictured with her dog\" class=\"wp-image-12328\" srcset=\"https://i0.wp.com/wordpress.org/news/files/2022/02/tonya-with-dog.jpg?w=300&amp;ssl=1 300w, https://i0.wp.com/wordpress.org/news/files/2022/02/tonya-with-dog.jpg?resize=150%2C150&amp;ssl=1 150w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\" /></figure></div>\n\n\n\n<p>Tonya went on to work with big and medium size WordPress companies helping their developers and supporting them in raising their firms’ leverage with WordPress.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>By late 2020, she knew she wanted to do even more with WordPress.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>In February 2021, Tonya joined an international firm in the ecosystem and began working closely on WordPress Core.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>At that time, WordPress Core was pulling together a new Triage team. Tonya started volunteering on that team to find collaborative solutions, and help others do so. In 2020 for <a href=\"https://wordpress.org/news/2020/12/simone/\">WordPress 5.6 Simone</a>, she became the release’s Triage lead, and again for <a href=\"https://make.wordpress.org/core/5-7/\">WordPress 5.7 Esperanza</a>.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>In 2021, she became a Test Team Rep and helped to expand the team and is an advocate for the value of testing and feedback in the release development process.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 id=\"a-new-successful-chapter-with-wordpress-5-9\">A new, successful chapter with WordPress 5.9</h2>\n\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-image\"><figure class=\"aligncenter size-large\"><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"1024\" height=\"480\" src=\"https://i1.wp.com/wordpress.org/news/files/2022/02/WP59-thumbnail-jb.png?resize=1024%2C480&#038;ssl=1\" alt=\"Tonya was one of the notable contributors to the WordPress 5.9 release featured in this picture.\" class=\"wp-image-12329\" srcset=\"https://i1.wp.com/wordpress.org/news/files/2022/02/WP59-thumbnail-jb.png?resize=1024%2C480&amp;ssl=1 1024w, https://i1.wp.com/wordpress.org/news/files/2022/02/WP59-thumbnail-jb.png?resize=300%2C141&amp;ssl=1 300w, https://i1.wp.com/wordpress.org/news/files/2022/02/WP59-thumbnail-jb.png?resize=768%2C360&amp;ssl=1 768w, https://i1.wp.com/wordpress.org/news/files/2022/02/WP59-thumbnail-jb.png?resize=1536%2C719&amp;ssl=1 1536w, https://i1.wp.com/wordpress.org/news/files/2022/02/WP59-thumbnail-jb.png?resize=2048%2C959&amp;ssl=1 2048w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\" /></figure></div>\n\n\n\n<p>Tonya’s passion for the software and getting people involved in its growth continued. For the WordPress 5.9 release in 2021, she took on the role of both the Core Tech Lead and the Release Coordinator. As this was a big release and included the first major implementation of Full Site Editing, it had many moving parts and hundreds of contributors. She was able to share the skills she had learned in communication and project management from her days streamlining and documenting engineering software and processes.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>In the first 24 hours of WordPress 5.9 landing, it had more than 10 million downloads—and 17 formally reported bugs.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 id=\"giving-back-to-open-source\">Giving back to open source</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Now in what Tonya describes as her third chapter. She said: “I’m a very different person from the engineer I used to know. What really matters in this world is when you reach out and make a difference in someone’s life.”</p>\n\n\n\n<p>She feels she has found her purpose in this life. “I’m on a mission to give back and make a difference. Teaching is how I will do it. And in WordPress I have found my professional home, and I have all this software knowledge that I just want to share.”</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 id=\"share-the-stories\">Share the stories</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Help share these stories of open source contributors and continue to grow the community. Meet more WordPressers in the <a href=\"https://wordpress.org/news/category/newsletter/interviews/\">People of WordPress series</a>.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 id=\"contributors-to-this-feature\">Contributors to this feature</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Thank you to Tonya Mork (<a href=\'https://profiles.wordpress.org/hellofromtonya/\' class=\'mention\'><span class=\'mentions-prefix\'>@</span>hellofromtonya</a>) for sharing her story. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Interviews and feature by Abha Thakor (<a href=\'https://profiles.wordpress.org/webcommsat/\' class=\'mention\'><span class=\'mentions-prefix\'>@</span>webcommsat</a>) and Mary Baum (<a href=\'https://profiles.wordpress.org/marybaum/\' class=\'mention\'><span class=\'mentions-prefix\'>@</span>marybaum</a>).

The podcast where you can catch quick explanations of the ideas behind the WordPress open source project. Some insight into the community that supports it and get a small list of big things coming up in the next two weeks. I&#8217;m your host, Josepha Haden Chomphosy &#8211; here we go!</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Josepha Haden Chomphosy [00:00:42]&nbsp;</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>I have a non-mailbag mailbag question that I would like to answer for y&#8217;all today. Non-mailbag because no one actually emailed me about it and mailbag because Twitter is basically like a giant mailbag. And I do get a lot of DMS about this particular topic. If you want to send something to my actual WP Briefing mailbag, you can send it to <a href=\"mailto:wpbriefing@worpress.org\">wpbriefing@worpress.org</a>.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Josepha Haden Chomphosy [00:01:06]&nbsp;</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>But the question that I frequently get asked in my DMS on Twitter is: what is Five for the Future? It&#8217;s not always that tidy the question, but that still is the question we&#8217;re answering today. So if you take a casual survey of active contributors to the WordPress project, the high-level answer that you&#8217;re likely to get to that question is “a way to remind people to give back to the project.” Or, if you run in more business-y circles, you might hear that it is an initiative that encourages companies to give back 5% of their resources.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Josepha Haden Chomphosy [00:01:40]&nbsp;</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>And both of those answers are true. So a quick mini-history lesson; the original concept of Five for the Future came from Matt Mullenweg in 2014. There&#8217;s a lovely blog post on it that I will link in the notes below, but it was essentially a call to any companies experiencing success with WordPress to contribute back to the project and make sure that the project was a success.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Josepha Haden Chomphosy [00:02:07]&nbsp;</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>The initial program then included outreach recognition, et cetera, proposed in 2017 by <a href=\"https://wordpress.org/support/users/liljimmi/\">Tracy Levesque</a> and <a href=\"https://wordpress.org/support/users/iandunn/\">Ian Dunn</a>. Then that was defined and formalized with the help of the WordPress community in 2018. And then, in 2019, we had our first trial run with entire dedicated teams sponsored by companies inside the WordPress ecosystem.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Josepha Haden Chomphosy [00:02:36]&nbsp;</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>So that&#8217;s the mini-history lesson chronology of this program. The intentions that informed the work of building the program in 2017 have become a bit lost to the ages. So I&#8217;m here to share it with you. The basic heart and soul of the Five for the Future program is to make sure that there is a way to refresh the commons of the WordPress community and ecosystem.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Josepha Haden Chomphosy [00:03:00]&nbsp;</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>And as a result, ensure that the common resources of WordPress are available long after we have stopped being available to care for them. If you are familiar with the concept of the tragedy of the commons, Five for the Future was created to help avoid that tragedy. There were two original goals for formalizing the program.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Josepha Haden Chomphosy [00:03:22]&nbsp;</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>The first one was to acknowledge companies that participated in Five for the Future by sponsoring contributors to work on the WordPress project. And the second was to motivate more companies to sponsor more volunteers. Either by hiring them and paying them to contribute or by assigning their existing employees to contribute to the WordPress project.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Josepha Haden Chomphosy [00:03:46]&nbsp;</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>Of course, it&#8217;s hard to quantify participation and hard to qualify what should be seen as an impactful contribution, which is why when the program was originally created, it was in partnership with team reps and community members who were active at the time. There are many posts around that discuss the next steps for this program.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Josepha Haden Chomphosy [00:04:07]&nbsp;</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>And as I&#8217;m looking through them, the next steps revolve around some of the hardest and most important questions that we have to answer as a project and as stewards of open source. Those questions are things like:</p>\n\n\n\n<ul><li> How do we remain true to these gloriously subversive values of WordPress and open source while also finding a way to thoughtfully secure our organization&#8217;s future?</li><li>Does contributing without the expectation of reciprocity hold up when we are looking at how to acknowledge contributors who sustain us?</li></ul>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Josepha Haden Chomphosy [00:04:40]&nbsp;</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>And if you&#8217;re familiar with Elinor Ostrom&#8217;s award-winning work, Governing the Commons, you may also be wondering how this particular program aligns with her eight principles designed to sustain organizations like ours.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Josepha Haden Chomphosy [00:04:57]&nbsp;</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>As an aside to that last question, this particular program does not have all eight principles accounted for, but among WordPress&#8217;s many programs, we do account for most of them. Although imperfectly, as is the way with human beings, that&#8217;s probably a whole episode unto itself, I did want to quickly answer that particular question.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Josepha Haden Chomphosy [00:05:16]&nbsp;</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>So to get back to my non-mailbag, mailbag question, if I had to tell you in the span of an elevator ride what Five for the Future was, this would be my answer. <strong>It is a v1 program with a dual goal of boldly declaring the need to refresh the shared resources of WordPress and offering the ways and means for communities and individuals alike to participate in refreshing those resources</strong>.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Josepha Haden Chomphosy [00:05:45]&nbsp;</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>If you want to learn more about the Five for the Future initiative, you can check out wordpress.org/5. Like literally just the number five. Or, if you want to learn more about the program that has grown from the Five for the Future initiative, you can check out the white paper that&#8217;s linked in the notes below.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Josepha Haden Chomphosy [00:06:11]&nbsp;</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>And that brings us now to our small list of big things. Number one on my small list, the planning post for WordPress 6.0 is out. I&#8217;ve included a link in my massive list of links below. But it includes our best guess at timing, features that we intend to include, and a call for volunteers as well. So if you are looking for ways to give back, that is a clear and immediate option.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Josepha Haden Chomphosy [00:06:38]&nbsp;</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>The second thing on the list is if you are a team rep, don&#8217;t forget that we have daylight saving time ending and starting depending on your hemisphere within the month. If you move meetings, if you&#8217;re in a team that moves your meetings, discuss it now so that folks have time to adjust their calendars.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Josepha Haden Chomphosy [00:06:55]&nbsp;</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>And the third thing on my small list of big things is that there&#8217;s a suite of Full Site Editing courses that are now available on learn.wordpress.org. I will add that to my giant list of links below, but I encourage you to wander on over and see what all the fuss is about. I think the courses are excellent.

Some insight into the community that supports it and get a small list of big things coming up in the next two weeks. I&#8217;m your host, Josepha Haden Chomphosy. Here we go!</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Josepha Haden Chomphosy&nbsp; </strong>01:07</p>\n\n\n\n<p>A couple of weeks ago, I published a post about the big picture goals for the WordPress project in 2022. As I was thinking through our planned releases for the year and looking out toward what would spell success for WordPress over the next three years, three things really lined up in both sets of answers for me.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Josepha Haden Chomphosy&nbsp; </strong>01:23</p>\n\n\n\n<p>I provided some detail on how we can work toward these goals in the post, which I will link for you in the show notes, but I also wanted to take some time to explain why I feel we have to work toward these goals this year. So these all build on one another. To refresh your memory of the three big focuses, they are one to drive adoption of the new editor in WordPress, support open source alternatives for site building necessities, and three, open source stewardship.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Josepha Haden Chomphosy&nbsp; </strong>01:52</p>\n\n\n\n<p>So the first one; is driving the adoption of the new WordPress editor. Early on in the start of the Gutenberg Project, folks could not go two days without hearing me talk about the phases of adoption and how those line up with the phases of Gutenberg, and who would need our support the most in each of those phases.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Josepha Haden Chomphosy&nbsp; </strong>02:09</p>\n\n\n\n<p>I have always believed that what we would be shipping at this point in our project would prove the plausible promise of what we were doing in phase one. That&#8217;s definitely what I&#8217;m seeing from what was shipped in 5.9, as well as what we plan to ship in May with 6.0. And the people who need the most support right now are absolutely our users, your clients, no matter whether they were not keeping up with WordPress developments or simply were waiting to see what all the fuss was about.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Josepha Haden Chomphosy&nbsp; </strong>02:37</p>\n\n\n\n<p>There will be people who look to you as someone who has been here a while to help them make sense of what they&#8217;re seeing. And what I find so exciting about this adoption, sort of, work in the WordPress project is that this is the time when we as practitioners of WordPress, no matter whether you are a designer or a developer or builder, business coach. This is the time when we get to guide others through the hardest parts of our learning processes.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Josepha Haden Chomphosy&nbsp; </strong>03:07</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The process of helping people to learn new technologies relies not only on your hard-won expertise but also on the belief that the future is worth fighting for. Enabling someone’s success is an investment in the future and investment for that person or for WordPress or your community. All investments are welcome here.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Josepha Haden Chomphosy&nbsp; </strong>03:28</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Fortunately, table stakes are just that you care. And speaking of future investments, the second focus is open source alternatives for site building necessities. So things like images, forms, stores, themes, etc. It literally just things you need to build a site. I would like to start by saying that I am completely aware of the fact that 99% of WordPress users will never care about open source freedoms and philosophies in the same way that WordPress maintainers and contributors care about open source freedoms and philosophies.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Josepha Haden Chomphosy&nbsp; </strong>04:04</p>\n\n\n\n<p>You could substitute the name of any other open source project right there, and the statement would still be true. And yet, I will always believe that people should have the rights and freedoms that open source brings to them even if they do not know they are there. And so it makes all the sense in the world to me that as a project and open source community, we should strive to make choosing Open Source as easy as possible.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Josepha Haden Chomphosy&nbsp; </strong>04:33</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And finally, open source stewardship is one of the focuses for this year. This one is obviously about supporting open source as a concept and maintaining WordPress as a project. But I also think that it is relevant to our current global circumstances. Open Source suddenly became very visible to the public eye last year following the Log4J vulnerability, and ever since then, I&#8217;ve been hearing consistent concern over how We make sure that WordPress is sustainable moving into the future. Fortunately, this is a topic that&#8217;s near and dear to my heart. And I have been delighted to see so many community members bringing that conversation to the forefront.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Josepha Haden Chomphosy&nbsp; </strong>05:14</p>\n\n\n\n<p>There is a lot that is done in the WordPress project to keep us from the tragedy of the commons. But that work honestly never ends. Not only does it not end, but as we get bigger, there is more and more that we can and should be doing to keep us around for the long term. And, of course, for the keen readers of my posts, there&#8217;s a bonus focus.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Josepha Haden Chomphosy&nbsp; </strong>05:39</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The bonus focus is, of course, that WordPress turns 20 years old next year. This year, we will also be seeing some preparatory work for that major milestone as well.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Josepha Haden Chomphosy&nbsp; </strong>05:56</p>\n\n\n\n<p>So that brings us today to our small list of big things. There is a redesign of the News Page coming. We&#8217;ve been talking about this over on make.wordpress.org/design for a bit since like June of last year or something. But it&#8217;s coming in the next few weeks. I&#8217;ll share a link to the GitHub repo in case anyone has any specific things that they see as they are reading through all of our many news stories that come out on that particular page.

This is more than just a new default theme. It’s a brand-new way to work with WordPress themes.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><a href=\"https://wordpress.org/support/article/block-themes/\">Block themes</a> put a wide array of visual choices directly in your hands, from color schemes and font combinations to page templates and image filters, all from the <a href=\"https://wordpress.org/support/article/site-editor/\">Site Editor</a>. So in one place, you can give Twenty Twenty-Two the same look and feel as your organization’s other materials—or take your site’s look in another direction.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>You already have the Twenty Twenty-Two theme—it came installed with WordPress 5.9. You will find it with your other installed themes.</p>\n\n\n\n<div style=\"height:10px\" aria-hidden=\"true\" class=\"wp-block-spacer\"></div>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-full\"><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"1204\" height=\"903\" src=\"https://i2.wp.com/wordpress.org/news/files/2022/01/5-9-release-2.png?resize=1204%2C903&#038;ssl=1\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-12102\" srcset=\"https://i2.wp.com/wordpress.org/news/files/2022/01/5-9-release-2.png?w=1204&amp;ssl=1 1204w, https://i2.wp.com/wordpress.org/news/files/2022/01/5-9-release-2.png?resize=300%2C225&amp;ssl=1 300w, https://i2.wp.com/wordpress.org/news/files/2022/01/5-9-release-2.png?resize=1024%2C768&amp;ssl=1 1024w, https://i2.wp.com/wordpress.org/news/files/2022/01/5-9-release-2.png?resize=768%2C576&amp;ssl=1 768w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\" /></figure>\n\n\n\n<h3 id=\"your-personal-paintbox-awaits\">Your personal paintbox awaits</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Twenty Twenty-Two is not the only theme built for full site editing. More block themes are in the Themes directory, and the number will grow.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>When you use any of those new themes, you no longer need the Customizer. Instead, you have all the power of the Styles interface inside the Site Editor. Just as in Twenty Twenty-Two, you build your site’s look and feel there, with the tools you need for the job in a fluid interface that practically comes alive in your hands.</p>\n\n\n\n<div style=\"height:10px\" aria-hidden=\"true\" class=\"wp-block-spacer\"></div>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-full\"><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"1204\" height=\"903\" src=\"https://i0.wp.com/wordpress.org/news/files/2022/01/5-9-release-3.png?resize=1204%2C903&#038;ssl=1\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-12103\" srcset=\"https://i0.wp.com/wordpress.org/news/files/2022/01/5-9-release-3.png?w=1204&amp;ssl=1 1204w, https://i0.wp.com/wordpress.org/news/files/2022/01/5-9-release-3.png?resize=300%2C225&amp;ssl=1 300w, https://i0.wp.com/wordpress.org/news/files/2022/01/5-9-release-3.png?resize=1024%2C768&amp;ssl=1 1024w, https://i0.wp.com/wordpress.org/news/files/2022/01/5-9-release-3.png?resize=768%2C576&amp;ssl=1 768w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\" /></figure>\n\n\n\n<h3 id=\"the-navigation-block\">The Navigation block</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Blocks come to site navigation, the heart of user experience.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The new Navigation block gives you the power to choose: an always-on responsive menu or one that adapts to your user’s screen size.

And you can edit them as you see fit. Need something different in the header or footer for your theme? Swap it out with a new one in a few clicks.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>With a nearly full-screen view that draws you in to see fine details, the Pattern Explorer makes it easy to compare patterns and choose the one your users need.</p>\n\n\n\n<div style=\"height:10px\" aria-hidden=\"true\" class=\"wp-block-spacer\"></div>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-full\"><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"1204\" height=\"903\" src=\"https://i2.wp.com/wordpress.org/news/files/2022/01/5-9-release-6.png?resize=1204%2C903&#038;ssl=1\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-12106\" srcset=\"https://i2.wp.com/wordpress.org/news/files/2022/01/5-9-release-6.png?w=1204&amp;ssl=1 1204w, https://i2.wp.com/wordpress.org/news/files/2022/01/5-9-release-6.png?resize=300%2C225&amp;ssl=1 300w, https://i2.wp.com/wordpress.org/news/files/2022/01/5-9-release-6.png?resize=1024%2C768&amp;ssl=1 1024w, https://i2.wp.com/wordpress.org/news/files/2022/01/5-9-release-6.png?resize=768%2C576&amp;ssl=1 768w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\" /></figure>\n\n\n\n<h3 id=\"a-revamped-list-view\">A revamped List View</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>In 5.9, the List View lets you drag and drop your content exactly where you want it.

The podcast where you can catch quick explanations of the ideas behind the WordPress open source project, some insight into the community that supports it, and get a small list of big things coming up in the next two weeks. I&#8217;m your host, Josepha Haden Chomphosy. Here we go!</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Josepha Haden Chomphosy&nbsp; </strong>00:40</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Yesterday marked three years since the WordPress project welcomed me as their executive director. As I start my fourth year, I&#8217;ve spent a bit of time considering what the next five years will bring us. WordPress will turn 19 this year, which means that we will soon be a whopping 20 years old; for some of the people who have been with the project since the beginning, that can represent two-thirds of their whole life. And even if you were not that young when you got here, two decades as an open source project is really a cause for celebration.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Josepha Haden Chomphosy&nbsp; </strong>01:10</p>\n\n\n\n<p>I am not in that group that has been here forever. I showed up for the first time in 2009, as a community organizer, self-sponsored, and I learned so much about myself as a person and as a leader while I was doing that. So when I arrived as a sponsored contributor in 2015, I already knew exactly what made this work so fulfilling for me was these three things:&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Josepha Haden Chomphosy&nbsp; </strong>01:34</p>\n\n\n\n<p>First, the ability to lend a hand in those moments where I wish someone had lent a hand.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Josepha Haden Chomphosy&nbsp; </strong>01:40</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Second is the delight of seeing people&#8217;s first successes and the joy of watching them grow over time.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Josepha Haden Chomphosy&nbsp; </strong>01:48</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And the third was a chance to be part of something great, which turned out to be something greater; greater than me or you or a CMS.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Josepha Haden Chomphosy&nbsp; </strong>01:58</p>\n\n\n\n<p>This list is still at the heart of what I feel I get out of the WordPress project. But it has also grown substantially in my seven years as a sponsored contributor. I now also love how we as a community of contributors get to foster a better way to lead and a better way to collaborate. And through those things help people find a way to have a better life. Not just through WordPress, the CMS, but through WordPress, the people, and WordPress, the project.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Josepha Haden Chomphosy&nbsp; </strong>02:25</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And so when I think of what I want for WordPress in its 19th year, so that we can head with confidence and dignity into our 20th year, it is this:&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Josepha Haden Chomphosy&nbsp; </strong>02:35</p>\n\n\n\n<p>I want you to remember that you are not alone here. People come together in the world often because of a shared location. But WordPress fosters this beautiful experience of bringing us together because of what we care about. Whether you care about PHP standards, diversity in technology, helping people with their first big wins, making WordPress more secure. I mean, if what you care about is being able to write the most arcane and complex apps on top of WordPress that the world has ever seen. Then there are others out there who want to do that with you, too. We have so many things to connect about. And fortunately, we support a great piece of software for getting our thoughts out in the world. Take some time to see who else shares your thoughts and potentially learn a bit about the view from the other side.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Josepha Haden Chomphosy&nbsp; </strong>03:26</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And speaking of the other side, I also want us to approach our discussions as the US versus the Problem TM. WordPress may be 20 years old, and we may stand on the shoulders of giants, but right now, the people who are here you, you are explorers and creators and guides toward the best possible future for WordPress. The tension that we witness between teams is always about the best possible answers for the people who use our software. It is about securing the freedoms of the open web for everyone who comes after us whether they know they need those freedoms or not.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Josepha Haden Chomphosy&nbsp; </strong>04:04</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And finally, I want us to expand our reasons for doing this at all. If you are a member of the community of contributors, We frequently talk about how we give back because WordPress gave to us. Or if you are part of a Five for the Future group. You have heard that companies who have experienced success because of WordPress should commit 5% of their resources back to the project to ensure WordPress&#8217; long-term success. But the reason that I keep doing this, and hopefully a new reason for you to keep doing this is that we can take part in securing opportunities for future users of WordPress.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Josepha Haden Chomphosy&nbsp; </strong>04:42</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Yes, I want WordPress to be the best CMS. Yes, I want this community to be vibrant and engaged. Yes, I want WordPress to be a shining beacon of how to work remotely. And I want all of that because I know it is our careful and tireless stewardship of this project that lets us continue to lend a hand in those moments where people wish for someone to lend a hand.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Josepha Haden Chomphosy&nbsp; </strong>05:11</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Those are my hopes for WordPress in 2022 to move us forward into WordPress of the future. I hope you all will come with me and we can continue our journey together.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Josepha Haden Chomphosy&nbsp; </strong>05:23</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Thanks again for listening. I&#8217;m Josepha Haden and this is the WP Briefing. See you again in a couple of weeks.</p>\n\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}s:30:\"com-wordpress:feed-additions:1\";a:1:{s:7:\"post-id\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:5:\"12043\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}}}}}s:27:\"http://www.w3.org/2005/Atom\";a:1:{s:4:\"link\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:0:\"\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:1:{s:0:\"\";a:3:{s:4:\"href\";s:32:\"https://wordpress.org/news/feed/\";s:3:\"rel\";s:4:\"self\";s:4:\"type\";s:19:\"application/rss+xml\";}}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}s:44:\"http://purl.org/rss/1.0/modules/syndication/\";a:2:{s:12:\"updatePeriod\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:9:\"\n	hourly	\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:15:\"updateFrequency\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:4:\"\n	1	\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}s:30:\"com-wordpress:feed-additions:1\";a:1:{s:4:\"site\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:8:\"14607090\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}}}}}}}}}}s:4:\"type\";i:128;s:7:\"headers\";O:42:\"Requests_Utility_CaseInsensitiveDictionary\":1:{s:7:\"\0*\0data\";a:9:{s:6:\"server\";s:5:\"nginx\";s:4:\"date\";s:29:\"Mon, 23 May 2022 18:34:25 GMT\";s:12:\"content-type\";s:34:\"application/rss+xml; charset=UTF-8\";s:25:\"strict-transport-security\";s:11:\"max-age=360\";s:6:\"x-olaf\";s:3:\"⛄\";s:13:\"last-modified\";s:29:\"Tue, 17 May 2022 16:42:37 GMT\";s:4:\"link\";s:63:\"<https://wordpress.org/news/wp-json/>; rel=\"https://api.w.org/\"\";s:15:\"x-frame-options\";s:10:\"SAMEORIGIN\";s:4:\"x-nc\";s:9:\"HIT ord 1\";}}s:5:\"build\";s:14:\"20211220193300\";}','no'),(136,'_transient_timeout_feed_mod_9bbd59226dc36b9b26cd43f15694c5c3','1653374066','no'),(137,'_transient_feed_mod_9bbd59226dc36b9b26cd43f15694c5c3','1653330866','no'),(138,'_transient_timeout_feed_d117b5738fbd35bd8c0391cda1f2b5d9','1653374067','no'),(139,'_transient_feed_d117b5738fbd35bd8c0391cda1f2b5d9','a:4:{s:5:\"child\";a:1:{s:0:\"\";a:1:{s:3:\"rss\";a:1:{i:0;a:6:{s:4:\"data\";s:3:\"\n\n\n\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:1:{s:0:\"\";a:1:{s:7:\"version\";s:3:\"2.0\";}}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";s:5:\"child\";a:1:{s:0:\"\";a:1:{s:7:\"channel\";a:1:{i:0;a:6:{s:4:\"data\";s:61:\"\n	\n	\n	\n	\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";s:5:\"child\";a:1:{s:0:\"\";a:5:{s:5:\"title\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:16:\"WordPress Planet\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"link\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:28:\"http://planet.wordpress.org/\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:8:\"language\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:2:\"en\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:11:\"description\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:47:\"WordPress Planet - http://planet.wordpress.org/\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"item\";a:50:{i:0;a:6:{s:4:\"data\";s:13:\"\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";s:5:\"child\";a:2:{s:0:\"\";a:5:{s:5:\"title\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:75:\"Post Status: WooCommerce Function of the Week: wc_get_product_category_list\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"guid\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:31:\"https://poststatus.com/?p=97560\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"link\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:89:\"https://cdn.poststatus.com/woocommerce-function-of-the-week-wc_get_product_category_list/\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:11:\"description\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:8904:\"<p class=\"has-drop-cap\">Here\'s yet another time-saving WooCommerce function.

(prefix / suffix)</li></ul>\n\n\n\n<p>Now to the function statements — actually, <em>statement</em>, as there is only one:</p>\n\n\n\n<pre class=\"wp-block-code\"><code>return get_the_term_list( $product_id, \'product_cat\', $before, $sep, $after );</code></pre>\n\n\n\n<p>That really sounds like a WordPress function as there is no mention of &#8220;woo,&#8221; &#8220;wc,&#8221; or any other WooCommerce prefixes. Let\'s look it up in the WordPress developer code reference documentation. (<a href=\"https://developer.wordpress.org/reference/functions/get_the_term_list/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">https://developer.wordpress.org/reference/functions/get_the_term_list/</a>)</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Here we go:</p>\n\n\n\n<pre class=\"wp-block-code\"><code>function get_the_term_list( $post_id, $taxonomy, $before = \'\', $sep = \'\', $after = \'\' ) {\n    $terms = get_the_terms( $post_id, $taxonomy );\n \n    if ( is_wp_error( $terms ) ) {\n        return $terms;\n    }\n \n    if ( empty( $terms ) ) {\n        return false;\n    }\n \n    $links = array();\n \n    foreach ( $terms as $term ) {\n        $link = get_term_link( $term, $taxonomy );\n        if ( is_wp_error( $link ) ) {\n            return $link;\n        }\n        $links&#91;] = \'&lt;a href=\"\' . esc_url( $link ) . \'\" rel=\"tag\"&gt;\' . $term-&gt;name . \'&lt;/a&gt;\';\n    }\n \n    /**\n     * Filters the term links for a given taxonomy.\n     *\n     * The dynamic portion of the hook name, `$taxonomy`, refers\n     * to the taxonomy slug.\n     *\n     * Possible hook names include:\n     *\n     *  - `term_links-category`\n     *  - `term_links-post_tag`\n     *  - `term_links-post_format`\n     *\n     * @since 2.5.0\n     *\n     * @param string&#91;] $links An array of term links.\n     */\n    $term_links = apply_filters( \"term_links-{$taxonomy}\", $links );  // phpcs:ignore WordPress.NamingConventions.ValidHookName.UseUnderscores\n \n    return $before . implode( $sep, $term_links ) . $after;\n}</code></pre>\n\n\n\n<p>Simple enough — <code>get_the_term_list</code> accepts basically the same parameters we covered above, plus the <code>$taxonomy</code> parameter, which in our case is passed as <code>product_cat</code> to tell WordPress we\'re retrieving WooCommerce product categories.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Here\'s how it works:</p>\n\n\n\n<ul><li><code>get_the_terms( $post_id, $taxonomy )</code> gets the product ID category objects.</li><li><code>$links</code> array gets filled with the list of categories, each with its own link.</li><li><code>return $before . implode( $sep, $term_links ) . $after</code> gives us the content we need: &#8220;prefix + $links separated with $sep + suffix&#8221;</li></ul>\n\n\n\n<h2>Function usage</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Define a product ID (e.g., 57) — and that\'s all you need to do!</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Call the function:</p>\n\n\n\n<pre class=\"wp-block-code\"><code>echo wc_get_product_category_list( 57 );</code></pre>\n\n\n\n<p>And see the magic happen:</p>\n\n\n\n<pre class=\"wp-block-code\"><code>cat1 link, cat2 link, cat3 link, ...</code></pre>\n\n\n\n<p>Of course, if you have access to the <code>$product global</code>, you can call the function dynamically. For example, if you want to call the function on every single product pages, you could do this:</p>\n\n\n\n<pre class=\"wp-block-code\"><code>echo wc_get_product_category_list( $product-&gt;get_id() );</code></pre>\n\n\n\n<p>Now I want to see where and when the function is called, so we give it a bit of context. With a quick search through the WooCommerce plugin, I find a single result in <code>\\woocommerce\\templates\\single-product\\meta.php</code>, line 34:</p>\n\n\n\n<pre class=\"wp-block-code\"><code>&lt;?php echo wc_get_product_category_list( $product-&gt;get_id(), \', \', \'&lt;span class=\"posted_in\"&gt;\' . _n( \'Category:\', \'Categories:\', count( $product-&gt;get_category_ids() ), \'woocommerce\' ) . \' \', \'&lt;/span&gt;\' ); ?&gt;</code></pre>\n\n\n\n<p>Which generates this output on my single product page:</p>\n\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-image\"><img width=\"752\" height=\"357\" src=\"https://cdn.poststatus.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/05/image-752x357.png\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-97562\" /></div>\n\n\n\n<p>Now we know <code>wc_get_product_category_list</code> is responsible for showing the list of categories in the single product page where it comes with a prefix (&#8216;Category:\' or &#8216;Categories:\' based on category count) plus the default comma separator and no suffix.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Let\'s use <code>wc_get_product_category_list</code> for our custom development example now and consider a quick case study.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 id=\"h-case-study\">Case study</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Where could <code>wc_get_product_category_list</code> come in handy?

TLDR: I\'m outputting the category list above the add to cart button.</li><li>I declare the global <code>$product</code> so that I can access the product ID.</li><li>I then call the <code>wc_get_product_category_list function</code>, with the following parameters:<ul><li><code>$product-&gt;get_id() <strong>-&gt; the product ID</strong></code></li><li><code>\' - \' <strong>-&gt; the separator</strong></code></li><li><code>\'&lt;p&gt;In: \' <strong>-&gt; the prefix</strong></code></li><li><code>\' \' . _n( \'category\', \'categories\', count( $product-&gt;get_category_ids() ), \'woocommerce\' ) . \'&lt;/p&gt; \' <strong>-&gt; the suffix</strong></code></li></ul></li></ul>\n\n\n\n<p>It\'s interesting how I reused this line from the single product page, as I mentioned above:</p>\n\n\n\n<pre class=\"wp-block-code\"><code>_n( \'category\', \'categories\', count( $product-&gt;get_category_ids() ), \'woocommerce\' )</code></pre>\n\n\n\n<p>Basically, if <code>count = 1</code> the first string is returned (singular &#8220;category&#8221;), while if <code>count &gt; 1</code> you get the plural &#8220;categories.&#8221; You can see the difference in the last screenshot above.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Any other use cases you have in mind?

Three years and ten major releases have radically changed the site building experience, but it&#8217;s not always easy to see recognize when focused on some of the smaller, iterative changes that slowly add up. Anne McCarthy, WordPress product liaison at Automattic and co-release coordinator for 6.0, has created a short 13-minute video that shows the immense amount of progress contributors have made on site building features.</p>\n\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-embed__wrapper\">\n\n</div>\n\n\n\n<p>McCarthy takes viewers back in time to WordPress 5.0, released in December 2018, which introduced the block editor and the Twenty Nineteen default theme through the work of 400+ contributors. She demonstrates using the Customizer with the default theme. These were simpler days and it&#8217;s clear now how limited the Customizer was for implementing the most basic changes. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>The video contrasts that experience with the upcoming 6.0 release, which features the work of 500+ contributors on features that didn&#8217;t exist three years ago.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>McCarthy quickly demonstrates the 6.0 site editing experience, swapping out template parts, and showcasing the breadth of the customization available for images, colors, typography, controlling the posts that are displayed, style variations, and the impressive array of design tools available.</p>\n\n\n\n<img />\n\n\n\n<p>Ten major versions later, nearly every aspect of a WordPress site is customizable through the site editor. For those who have not yet made the leap into full-site editing &#8211; it&#8217;s essentially like the old Customizer but with super powers, better instant previews, and the interface is a panel on the right. At this point, I don&#8217;t think the usability is at a level where someone can just get in there and immediately know what they are doing. It takes a little bit of exploring, but it&#8217;s moving in the right direction.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Videos like this one show what is possible and just how far WordPress has come since it first introduced the block editor. It also indirectly answers Joost de Valk&#8217;s recent claims that <a href=\"https://joost.blog/wordpress-market-share-shrinking/\">the full-site editing project not being done yet is partially to blame</a> for WordPress&#8217; recent <a href=\"https://wptavern.com/wordpress-community-attributes-declining-market-share-to-performance-issues-increased-complexity-and-the-lagging-full-site-editing-project\">decline in market share</a>. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>While WordPress remains the uncontested market leader among CMS&#8217;s, some say this small percentage of a decline is inconsequential. Matt Mullenweg has stated in previous interviews that he views market share stats as a &#8220;<a href=\"https://wptavern.com/matt-mullenweg-and-david-heinemeier-hansson-discuss-wordpress-market-share-monopolies-and-power-in-open-source-communities\">trailing indicator</a>&#8221; in the quest to create the best possible experience for users and developers. A growing market share, in that sense, is a signal of user satisfaction. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>WordPress jumped into the block paradigm at the right time, just as many other apps began adopting the concept of composable blocks for creating content and designs. Full-site editing is the extension of that vision but it takes time to make it something polished and delightful to use.

The development team intends to publish an upgrade guide to support adoption of custom order tables after migrations have been ironed out.

The SFC alleges that Vizio has demonstrated “repeated failures to fulfill even the basic requirements of the General Public License (GPL),&#8221; after the company refused to provide the source code for software with copyleft licenses that it bundles with its products.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Vizio had filed a request to “remove” the case from California State Court into U.S. Federal Court. After hearing oral arguments from both sides, the court has granted SFC&#8217;s motion to remand the case back to California State Court. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>In the <a href=\"https://storage.courtlistener.com/recap/gov.uscourts.cacd.837808/gov.uscourts.cacd.837808.30.0.pdf\">ruling</a>, US District Court judge Josephine L. Staton stated that the GPL introduces &#8220;an additional contractual promise separate and distinct from any rights provided by the copyright laws:&#8221;</p>\n\n\n\n<blockquote class=\"wp-block-quote\"><p>The Court finds Versata’s reasoning persuasive, and it finds here, as the court<br />found there, that the enforcement of “an additional contractual promise separate and distinct from any rights provided by the copyright laws” amounts to an “extra element,” and therefore, SFC’s claims are not preempted. Id. at *5. There is an extra element to SFC’s claims because SFC is asserting, as a third-party beneficiary of the GPL Agreements, that it is entitled to receive source code under the terms of those agreements. There is no right to receive certain works—or source code in particular—under the Copyright Act; indeed, the Act’s primary purpose is to limit who may reproduce, prepare derivative works, distribute, and display protected works. As SFC points out in its briefing, the right to receive the source code would appear to be “the very opposite” of those exclusive rights. (Reply, Doc. 26, at 17.) The fact that SFC claims status as a third-party beneficiary to the GPL Agreements and not the actual copyright holder—and therefore, has no authority to impose limitations on the reproduction and distribution of the software—only underscores that the contractual right at issue is qualitatively different from the rights under the Copyright Act. Thus, there can be no question that the extra element—that SFC is third-party enforcing its right to receive source code under the terms of a contract—transforms the nature of the action.</p></blockquote>\n\n\n\n<p>One of the functions of the SFC is to assist member projects in enforcing the terms of FLOSS licenses, including through litigation. This particular case is unique because the organization is presenting this lawsuit on behalf of individual consumers, as opposed to the traditional path of defending copyright holders of the GPL code in question.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>“The ruling is a watershed moment in the history of copyleft licensing,&#8221; SFC executive director Karen Sandler said. &#8220;This ruling shows that the GPL agreements function both as copyright licenses and as contractual agreements.&#8221;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>SFC  contends that many electronics products are built for planned premature obsolescence and that companies often do this by violating the GPL. If the product is bundled with copyleft software, a consumer has the right to modify, improve, and repair the software.

I suspect that you&#8217;ve heard about block patterns, but if you haven&#8217;t, you&#8217;re in for a treat.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Patterns are collections of blocks which anyone can assemble for easy reuse at a later date.

Wouldn&#8217;t it be great if there was a source of patterns which we could use in our WordPress websites, safe in the knowledge that they were completely free to use? There is, and it&#8217;s called the pattern directory. You simply find a pattern that you like and copy paste it into your site.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>You could stop there, but you could also use this as a way of learning how blocks are constructed.

There&#8217;s a few hundred pounds to explore, but it could certainly do with some more contributions. And that is what this podcast is about. The pattern creator is the way to create patterns so that they can be submitted, reviewed, and hopefully accepted into the Pattern Directory. We&#8217;ve got two perspectives on the podcast today from people who come at it from different angles.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Ana is a self-taught WordPress themer, and a designer who is making use of patterns in her website builds. And Kelly is an Automattician who has been working with the team building the Pattern Directory and Creator. We talk about how the creator works, how you can submit your patterns and what constraints are there for having your submissions accepted.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>So, if you&#8217;re curious about how patterns can speed up your website building workflow, this episode is for you.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>If you&#8217;re interested in finding out more, you can find all the links in the show notes by heading over to WP tavern.com forward slash podcast, where you&#8217;ll find all the other episodes as well.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And so without further delay, I bring you Ana Segota and Kelly Choyce-Dwan.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>I am joined on the podcast today by Ana Segota and Kelly Choyce-Dwan. Hello.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:04:01] <strong>Ana Segota:</strong> Hi.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:04:01] <strong>Kelly Choyce-Dwan:</strong> Hello.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:04:02] <strong>Nathan Wrigley:</strong> Very nice to have you both here. As we always do at the beginning of the podcast, I&#8217;m going to give both of you an opportunity to introduce yourselves, to give us a bit of an orientation.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>If you&#8217;ve listened to the introduction to this podcast, you probably know that we&#8217;re going to be talking about the pattern creator. And so it would be important to know why the two guests today are coming on talking about that. So, we&#8217;ll take it one at a time. We&#8217;ll begin with Ana. Ana, just tell us a little bit about your journey with WordPress and how come it is that you became involved with the pattern creator.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:04:33] <strong>Ana Segota:</strong> So, hi Nathan, nice to meet you and thank you for inviting me. So I&#8217;m Ana Segota, and I am a themer, and I love creating WordPress themes using block patterns. I always was more as a designer, but I learned to code to be able to create WordPress themes myself, but now having a block patterns is such a relief for me because I can concentrate on design more.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:05:04] <strong>Nathan Wrigley:</strong> That&#8217;s really nice. Thank you. Yeah. The intention of the tool is to make all of those decisions a little bit easier. So it&#8217;s nice, nice to know that in your case, it&#8217;s working. So, okay that&#8217;s going to be one perspective that we&#8217;ve got in the show today. And another perspective comes from Kelly. So Kelly, just spend a moment, tell us who you are please.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:05:21] <strong>Kelly Choyce-Dwan:</strong> Sure. So my name is Kelly Choyce-Dwan, also ryelle online. I work at Automattic and I have for over seven years. I started with WordPress in 2009, and I&#8217;m now working on the Meta team where my focus recently has been on the pattern directory and pattern creator.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:05:41] <strong>Nathan Wrigley:</strong> Now many people listening to this podcast will be very up-to-date users of WordPress. There&#8217;ll be using the tools that are shipping all of the time, and they may well have discovered patterns and be using them to great effect.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>On the other hand, I suspect that there&#8217;ll be a fair amount of people who as yet have not delved into patterns. They may know what they are. They may not. So I&#8217;m wondering if we could really just rewind a little bit, make no assumptions about anybody&#8217;s knowledge about patterns and just lay out what they are. So it&#8217;s a very general question. Either of you feel free to answer it. What are patterns in WordPress and why might you wish to use them?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:06:24] <strong>Ana Segota:</strong> So for me block patterns, I like predefined and ready to use layout that you can click or drug and create pages. It&#8217;s like a collection of blocks arranged together to help you create different layouts. If you&#8217;ve used sometimes page builders, or Elementor templates, for example, it&#8217;s the same thing. You can use them on your website. You can adjust them, change the layout, change the colors. And I think they&#8217;re very useful.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:06:59] <strong>Nathan Wrigley:</strong> Thank you. So they are basically quick ways to build websites. You&#8217;re using other people&#8217;s predefined layouts. The work, in great measure, has been done for you. You can discover collections of blocks, which are generically called patterns, and you can click on those and import them into your post or page or whatever it might be.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>So it speeds things up. I&#8217;m curious, for those of you, who&#8217;ve never used this before again, how do you actually build them? What&#8217;s the process that one might find themselves in, and bear in mind, we might be speaking to users of WordPress who are familiar with page builders, and don&#8217;t really find themselves interacting with the WordPress block editor.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>So we may need to have a little bit of a description around there. What are we actually doing? How do we create and build patterns?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:07:51] <strong>Ana Segota:</strong> Okay. so mostly, I&#8217;m building block patterns for the themes. As a background, I first start, with niche, different niche, and what can be useful for that niche. And then I start creating block patterns directly in the editor, where you have all the options of block that you can combine in one block pattern.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>So mostly I started with a group block, where I put then columns or cover or images, and start creating different ideas and different layout.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:08:34] <strong>Nathan Wrigley:</strong> Are you able to save those, as WordPress currently stands? Are you able to save those and I&#8217;ll stay with Ana. Are you able to save those Ana so that they can be reused on other websites. In other words, can you save more time by having your own little collection of blocks, which you then can use on this website over here and this other completely different website?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:08:58] <strong>Ana Segota:</strong> Maybe Kelly knows better, the other way, but what I know you can always copy the block you have and paste it on other website. Or you can export it. But not sure if you can save it inside the editor for like a gallery or something. I&#8217;m not sure that you can, or if you can do this, maybe Kelly knows that.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:09:22] <strong>Kelly Choyce-Dwan:</strong> Well, I know that you can, if you copy the block code into like a code file, the you can register it that way, but it requires code.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:09:33] <strong>Ana Segota:</strong> I think, there is no easy way to save it in a gallery for the beginner user, for example.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:09:41] <strong>Nathan Wrigley:</strong> At the moment, it feels as though it is the domain of people who are fairly experienced with WordPress. All of the tooling, with things like Elementor that you described, where you, you might have a private cloud of things that you&#8217;ve created in the past, and you can log in, and there&#8217;s a cloud service attached and you can download those to all of the other websites. We&#8217;re not quite at that point yet, although maybe some of the discussion that we&#8217;ll have today will revolve around that.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:10:10] <strong>Ana Segota:</strong> Yeah, I would love that.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:10:12] <strong>Nathan Wrigley:</strong> Yeah, that would be a really nice addition.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:10:14] <strong>Ana Segota:</strong> But I think the, pattern creator is doing some kind of saving those block patterns and one place where you can reuse it. But we will come to it.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:10:24] <strong>Nathan Wrigley:</strong> That&#8217;s okay. We&#8217;ll come to that in a moment. Just to say, patterns are collections of blocks and you piece them together, akin to a jigsaw and you build up designs, and style those designs, add images, add forms, add whatever it might be, background, color, padding, and so on, until you&#8217;ve got something that you&#8217;d like to look off. And at the moment, it probably lives within one WordPress website. But you can copy and paste that over somewhere else, but there&#8217;s no sort of cloud functionality.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And so, to the main conversation today, which is the pattern creator. Just so that you know, the links will be in the show notes to everything that we talk about today. And the pattern creator may well be something that you want to go and play with because it enables you to do a very large amount more than potentially you can do in your normal WordPress website. So, whoever wishes to take this. What is the pattern creator? Hopefully we&#8217;ll be providing people with the link so they can find that. That&#8217;s all good. But what&#8217;s the purpose of it? Why was it built? Why did the WordPress team decide that a tool like this needed to exist?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:11:33] <strong>Kelly Choyce-Dwan:</strong> So the pattern creator is a place to go and create patterns to share with anyone who uses WordPress, and it was created to make the process of making a sharing patterns easier. It&#8217;s a place that you can go and make a pattern and you know that it can be reused without having to write that code.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:11:54] <strong>Nathan Wrigley:</strong> So, at the moment it&#8217;s not only is it a place where you can go and create patterns. It&#8217;s a place where you can go and discover other people&#8217;s already created patterns. And if you&#8217;re, if you&#8217;re coming to this podcast from another page builder, think about it as rows. You&#8217;re essentially grabbing rows from websites or component parts of websites. And so it serves that double purpose. Not only can you create your own, but you can also go and freely download other people&#8217;s work. Have I got that right? Have I misstated that?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:12:25] <strong>Kelly Choyce-Dwan:</strong> That&#8217;s correct?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:12:26] <strong>Nathan Wrigley:</strong> So in terms of how the editor works, we need to go to the website, the pattern creator website. And once we&#8217;re there, my understanding is that you need a, a wordpress.org account.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Once you&#8217;ve got yourself, a wordpress.org account, you can log in and you are presented with something which looks very, very similar to the usual WordPress block editor interface. It&#8217;s a little bit more spartan because the menu on the left kind of basically doesn&#8217;t exist. So all of those options for posts and pages and what have you are gone. Let&#8217;s talk about the design decisions.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>So the menu on the left is gone. We&#8217;ve got the option to add blocks. Are we just dealing with a subset of the core blocks or can we add any of the core blocks?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:13:15] <strong>Kelly Choyce-Dwan:</strong> It is a subset currently, because we don&#8217;t have the dynamic content that might be on your website. So we can&#8217;t replicate the full experience of using that block. But almost all of the core blocks are available.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:13:30] <strong>Nathan Wrigley:</strong> Okay, so you can log in and you can start building out your blocks, or rather, I should say you can start building out your patterns. Then presumably there&#8217;s some kind of save process. And if you&#8217;re happy with things, can you use this if you chose to do it this way, can you use this as a private repository of your own blocks, that you&#8217;re maybe not ready to share with the world? Maybe they have to be kept in a draft state or something like that. Could it be used in that way? I know that&#8217;s not the intention. The intention is to have them shareable, but you were to design something and be not entirely satisfied with it, could you keep it there and come back to it at a later date and tweak it?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:14:13] <strong>Kelly Choyce-Dwan:</strong> Yeah, totally. You can save things as drafts. Actually, when we were first building it out, one of the ideas was that it could be a private repo for you to put your own patterns in. That isn&#8217;t built yet, but it could be in the future.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:14:26] <strong>Nathan Wrigley:</strong> So there is a kind of workaround to make it a directory of your own, if you simply save things as draft. But that isn&#8217;t the point. The intention is to make it universally available to everybody. And so on.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Does this require an up to date version of Gutenberg on the backend? So just to be clear, it&#8217;s like a SaaS product. You&#8217;re not installing WordPress anywhere. You are just going to a website and interacting with it. But I&#8217;m just curious to know, as Gutenberg is updated and modified and the blocks change, we&#8217;re several years in, and there&#8217;s been a great deal of change in the way that certain things work.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Do you have confidence that everything that you build today will look the same in, let&#8217;s say a couple of years time. In other words, do you anticipate that some things may break in the future or are you trying as hard as possible to mitigate against that?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:15:18] <strong>Kelly Choyce-Dwan:</strong> Well, I hope it won&#8217;t, but the pattern creator is using always the stable version of Gutenberg. So it will always be up-to-date when you&#8217;re creating patterns. Patterns created a few months ago, we&#8217;re created with an older version of Gutenberg, but between backwards compatibility block transformation, Gutenberg is trying not to break your content too. So I&#8217;m fairly confident that things will continue to work. If there are patterns that do brake, we have a reporting mechanism for reporting that.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:15:51] <strong>Nathan Wrigley:</strong> So it&#8217;s just Core blocks that we need to worry about. And it&#8217;s a subset of the Core blocks. Now, I&#8217;m looking on the interface at the moment. There&#8217;s the option for me to add a title? Obviously that&#8217;s just for the purposes of knowing what the pattern is that I&#8217;m saving somewhere. And then I can, in the normal way, click the little plus icon and I can add blocks as I choose. Put a group in, put some columns in and so on, and fiddle with those blocks just as I would do on my regular WordPress website.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And I&#8217;ve got the list view where I can see the stack of all of the different things that. I&#8217;ve created. And then on the right-hand side, you&#8217;ve got a title and a description. Do both of those serve the purpose of showing to somebody, once it&#8217;s been submitted to the pattern directory, which we&#8217;ll get onto in just a moment. Those titles and descriptions would give the people, browsing the pattern directory, some orientation as to what it was about and what it was designed to achieve.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:16:46] <strong>Kelly Choyce-Dwan:</strong> Yeah, that&#8217;s right. The title is the pattern title, and it&#8217;s the same when you&#8217;re in that little sidebar and the top title, they&#8217;re just two inputs for the same thing. Good title would describe what the pattern is, like one of the pattern contains, what it should be used for.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:17:01] <strong>Nathan Wrigley:</strong> Then in order to presumably aid search on the other end in the pattern directory. Currently we have six categories. There&#8217;s no option to create categories of your own. At the minute we look like we&#8217;ve got buttons, columns, gallery, header, images, text, and then there&#8217;s the option to add in keywords, maximum of 10.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Again, is this all just to help the taxonomy of it, to help assist people on the other side to locate things which you&#8217;ve got buttons in and specifically columns and galleries and so on? Is that the That&#8217;s the sole purpose of that.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:17:34] <strong>Kelly Choyce-Dwan:</strong> That&#8217;s right. And, they&#8217;re also used, those are the same properties that are used in WordPress Core when you&#8217;re registering patterns.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:17:41] <strong>Nathan Wrigley:</strong> So I could spend hours happily building out my new blocks and constructing them up into patterns and saving them away. And once I&#8217;ve got something that I&#8217;m happy with, there&#8217;s a blue submit button at the top right hand corner in the same way that you would have publish in WordPress typically, but this is submit.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>What is the process, what&#8217;s going on there? What is the list of things which happen after that? So I&#8217;m thinking in terms of, I just clicked submit, but presumably at that point, all sorts of other things are set in motion. Maybe it&#8217;s sent to a particular team and people have to authorize things and check that it doesn&#8217;t break any guidelines. And that might be a long list of things that go on in the background there.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:18:24] <strong>Kelly Choyce-Dwan:</strong> Yeah. So when you submit a pattern, it asks you a few things more just to make sure you filled out all of your details. there are a few things that we&#8217;ll check for automatically, making sure you&#8217;re using a decent title. We&#8217;ve had a few patterns that are just called my pattern, which isn&#8217;t helpful for other people. So we detect things like that.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>So after the automated checks, it does get submitted as pending. So it does not automatically approved yet. And there is a pattern review team that will look through the pending patterns and publish things that are valid. Most things do get published. So you probably would get published within a day or two.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:19:02] <strong>Ana Segota:</strong> It&#8217;s mostly hours or a day. I submitted here, so top, one day</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:19:08] <strong>Nathan Wrigley:</strong> Yeah, it&#8217;s really quick. A big gripe about the, let&#8217;s say the theme review team or the plugin review team was that there was quite a long wait, sometimes very long. There&#8217;s a lot more complexity, I guess, within a theme, a lot more code floating about. So at the moment. if you submit something, as of, let&#8217;s say May 2022, you&#8217;re very likely to have a decision fairly quickly.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>In terms of that being authorized, what are the guidelines? What are the kinds of things that are allowed and disallowed? In other words, so you mentioned that a good title, a good descriptive title is going to set you on the road to having its, authorized and put on the pattern directory.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Are there any other guidelines that need to be, you need to be mindful of? Not only in terms of getting it submitted, but things that you don&#8217;t want people to submit because it contravenes certain rules or regulations.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:20:03] <strong>Ana Segota:</strong> I think the most important part is to combine multiple blocks together, so not just to use one block and post it. So multiply blocks together and create some interesting and useful layouts. So maybe front design part and also something that can be creative and useful to the users. Also to highlight the capabilities of the blocks they contain and provide a starting point to customize the content.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Good pattern book needs to be, has a well-defined purpose too. And for don&#8217;ts, maybe to avoid to design patterns for a single theme. So to think about it to be used in different websites. Not to create a pattern that is like a full page. Or just a simple pattern that is using a paragraph. And I think you need to use photos from the gallery there. You can&#8217;t import your photos or from some other website, and that&#8217;s probably it.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:21:11] <strong>Nathan Wrigley:</strong> So the photos are coming in from, Kelly, maybe you can help us out here. Are they coming in from Openverse?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:21:18] <strong>Kelly Choyce-Dwan:</strong> They are yeah. It&#8217;s all CC0 photos from Openverse. So they&#8217;re able to be used by anyone without any, without worry about crediting people.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:21:27] <strong>Ana Segota:</strong> Yeah, that&#8217;s very helpful.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:21:30] <strong>Nathan Wrigley:</strong> Another podcast episode altogether isn&#8217;t it? The whole Openverse project&#8217;s fabulous. Yeah. so obviously there&#8217;s constraints in terms of the do&#8217;s, you know, it needs to be usable on multiple websites, and so on, just as Ana said, but there&#8217;s some certain don&#8217;ts as well. We&#8217;ve prevented the ability to upload images by just using Openverse images, which is great.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>But also, I guess that would be in terms of the text that you write into paragraph or heading fields, there would be a requirement for it to be, let&#8217;s call it family friendly. You know, we don&#8217;t want anything which might cause anybody any hassle and presumably that&#8217;s a trip wire which the team would immediately reject it on.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>So, okay. Let&#8217;s let&#8217;s imagine that we&#8217;ve built this fabulous pattern. It&#8217;s absolutely hit the guidance on the head and it&#8217;s been approved. What then? Where does it go? Where does it live? How can other people find it?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:22:24] <strong>Kelly Choyce-Dwan:</strong> So it&#8217;s in the pattern directory, which is just wordpress.org/patterns. You can use that website to search through patterns. Once you found a pattern that you like, you&#8217;re able to use it in your own website, just by simply copying it. And there is a copy button on each pattern that you can use to copy the code for it.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And if you just paste that straight into your editor, you have that pattern.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:22:48] <strong>Nathan Wrigley:</strong> So, you go to the pattern directory, presumably you would then search and filter against the things which you created when you were submitting your pattern. And then there&#8217;s a simple copy and paste button. You copy it. It&#8217;s in the clipboard of your computer and you just go over to your website and in an empty block, there&#8217;s no sort of container or wrapper that you need to stick it in. You literally just paste it into a brand new empty text block and all will work?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:23:18] <strong>Kelly Choyce-Dwan:</strong> Yep.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:23:19] <strong>Ana Segota:</strong> Yeah.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:23:19] <strong>Nathan Wrigley:</strong> Are there any gotchas there? Because that process, whilst it&#8217;s not necessarily quite as optimal as the cloud that we were talking about earlier, where you could actually see it within your WordPress website, which I guess ultimately would be an easier experience?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Does it always work? Are there any situations where copying and pasting that code has unexpected consequences. I don&#8217;t mean things breaking. I just mean that the styling, for example, something that the theme brings to bear might make things look peculiar and not quite how you intended.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:23:51] <strong>Kelly Choyce-Dwan:</strong> Yeah, I think that&#8217;s possible because it is, I mean it uses the Core blocks. So if your theme styles the core blocks minimally, maybe, you&#8217;ll probably be fine, but if your theme is doing anything really creative with some of the blocks, I suppose you could have some trouble where a quote that you copied from the pattern directory looks totally different on your site.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:24:12] <strong>Ana Segota:</strong> But if you are using a full site editing theme, I think you are good with.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:24:17] <strong>Nathan Wrigley:</strong> It should just work. Yeah. Do you know if there&#8217;s any intention to bring any of this kind of functionality into WordPress Core. And what I&#8217;m meaning by that is that I could hook up my let&#8217;s say wordpress.org account to my website. And then I could create patterns inside my website and then authorize them to be submitted to the pattern directory.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>I feel like that might be quite a useful workflow at some point in the future, because then you&#8217;re not necessarily having to go out and go to a different website in order to create the patterns and publish them and so on. And equally, I wonder if in the future there are any plans to make it so that I can pull these patterns in, in the same way that we described that page builders like Elementor and so on, have their cloud templates and so on, and so forth.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:25:11] <strong>Kelly Choyce-Dwan:</strong> Yeah, I think the second is much more likely than the first. So if you were to create a pattern on your own website. Uh, you might be using any number of blocks that are not Core blocks. So I don&#8217;t know that creating a pattern on your website and pushing it up is on the roadmap at least, because there&#8217;s a lot more gotchas. We can&#8217;t control the media that you&#8217;re using. Like we&#8217;re able to use Open verse images on the pattern creator.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>So there&#8217;s a lot more, a lot more like gotchas that way. But, having an ability to pull patterns from the pattern directory on wordpress.org into your own site. I do think that that is probably going to happen soon.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Already, you can call out, well already in WordPress 6.0, you&#8217;ll be able to register pattern slugs when you&#8217;re building a theme, and then it will pull down those patterns from the pattern directory. So you can pull patterns like that.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:26:06] <strong>Nathan Wrigley:</strong> Yeah. That&#8217;s, that&#8217;s interesting. So imagine that I&#8217;ve submitted one of my patterns. I&#8217;m very happy with it, but a year or two passes and I now for goodness knows what reason, I now don&#8217;t wish that pattern to be part of the directory. I&#8217;m wondering if either of you have any knowledge about whether things can be removed or once I&#8217;ve submitted it, is it up there for life? And I have essentially given it over to the community in perpetuity.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:26:36] <strong>Kelly Choyce-Dwan:</strong> You can revert your pattern to draft, if you want to take it down. You can also trash it. We&#8217;re not tied to always supporting things the way that the theme and plugin directories are because there isn&#8217;t really as much of a tie to your content and this thing on wordpress.org, because once you copy a pattern down, you have it, you don&#8217;t need to sync back up with the parent. So we don&#8217;t need to, we don&#8217;t have the same issues of keeping something around.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:27:00] <strong>Nathan Wrigley:</strong> Yeah, so you can curate that yourself. You can just, if you like return it to a draft status. So there&#8217;s a permanent connection between the wordpress.org repository that I can access with my user login and password, and the pattern being published. In other words, when I clicked submit, it&#8217;s not just taken from my submission and put into some other SaaS, if you like.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>So my expectation was that when I submitted it, much in the same way that I was submitting a form on a website, that form can then live somewhere else. You know, the form submission can come to me via email. I can&#8217;t rescind that form being sent. But in the directory the submit button and the draft status button is directly connected to whether it&#8217;s on the pattern directory.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>So if I click draft again, it will immediately, without any human supervision, it will suck it out of the directory and mean that it&#8217;s no longer there.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:28:03] <strong>Kelly Choyce-Dwan:</strong> Yeah, that that&#8217;s correct.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:28:05] <strong>Nathan Wrigley:</strong> Yeah, I really didn&#8217;t understand that. I just assumed that I was submitting it rather like a form. Somebody would inspect it, check it into another platform. So that&#8217;s kind of good to know.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:28:15] <strong>Kelly Choyce-Dwan:</strong> Yeah. It also means that you can edit. So if you make your pattern and then you decide that you actually, you&#8217;ve submitted it, it&#8217;s been a week though. And you don&#8217;t like the color of the button. You can make that change. It&#8217;ll submit it back to pending, and it has to go through that review again. But, once it&#8217;s published, your pattern will have the new change now.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:28:34] <strong>Nathan Wrigley:</strong> Okay. So we have to go through the process. Do you have any insight into how popular patterns have become over time? I mean, I still feel that the editing experience for proprietary page builders is something that people are keen for Gutenberg to have. You know, in other words, what you see is literally what you get.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>There&#8217;s no ifs or buts, it&#8217;s just exactly the same on the backend as it is on the front end. And I feel that a lot of people are not moving over to Gutenberg because that experience is not there yet. So, this one may be for Kelly, it may be for Ana. Ana, you might like to draw on, you know, your experience or maybe your friends and colleagues. Is it as usable yet? Are patterns as useful to you as your page builder that you may have used in the past yet? Or if we still got a way to go, what are your, what are your instincts on that?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:29:25] <strong>Ana Segota:</strong> From my point of view, I think the block patterns are now really well made and they can be really useful. And I think they are mostly easier to use them. So for the user&#8217;s point of view, but they come more to the problem where we are starting to use templates, for example. Full site editing and templates. Block patterns are I think easiest part from the whole full site editing,.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>From my experience, mostly they like block patterns but, I think we are still in early stage because there is not a lot of themes that are full site editing themes. And sometimes we also have older themes that we are updating with block patterns, but it&#8217;s like a mix of old way and new way. So I think when we start doing more full site editing themes, it will get easier and user will get to know znd to accept it more.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>But I think block patterns are really useful from the user side, but templates are a bit tricky now, I must say, a bit confusing because we have a two editors now, like site editor and normal editor that they know from past. And they&#8217;re asking why I see now here block pattern, but in the old editor I need to click on the edit template to edit the template. It&#8217;s a bit tricky and confusing at the moment I must confess.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:31:00] <strong>Nathan Wrigley:</strong> We&#8217;re on the cusp of WordPress 6.0 being released, and as each different, a new release comes around, there is more being added and the complexity sometimes goes up and hopefully at some point the complexity will go down again and be more straightforward to use.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>I guess that one of the biggest wins of using patterns and the pattern directory, which you would submit things to with the creator, is that all of this is just free. It&#8217;s completely freely available. You can use it in any which way you&#8217;d like, there&#8217;s no constraints over how you might use it. And if we rewind the clock about, oh, I don&#8217;t know, let&#8217;s go for about 12 or 13 years.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>I imagine that the plug-in directory felt like a similar thing, you know, you would submit your plugin and within a few hours, somebody would say yes. That&#8217;s great, thank you very much. We now know that WordPress has 50,000 plus plugins. The directory whilst being very useful is quite hard, it&#8217;s very difficult to track things down. We&#8217;ve got certain things being recommended because they&#8217;re popular and it may be hard for people to have their bits and pieces discovered.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>I&#8217;m just wondering, Kelly I&#8217;ll fire this one at you. I&#8217;m just wondering if in the future there are plans to make it so that as you submit patterns, there&#8217;s maybe more options around curating it, more taxonomy, terms, greater ways of being able to search and discover things. Because at the moment, it&#8217;s easy.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>There&#8217;s a handful of patterns, well, that&#8217;s not quite true, but you get point. There aren&#8217;t 50,000 of them. But in the future, when this takes off, I could see there being literally hundreds of thousands of patterns. And at that point it&#8217;s going to be extremely difficult to separate the ones that you would like from the ones which are just there in front of you, but you don&#8217;t necessarily feel able to use. So really I&#8217;m just wondering how that may be curated in the future. Any roadmap plans for that?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:33:00] <strong>Kelly Choyce-Dwan:</strong> Yeah. you&#8217;re right there are, what did you say, 50,000 plugins?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:33:03] <strong>Nathan Wrigley:</strong> Yeah,</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:33:04] <strong>Kelly Choyce-Dwan:</strong> Yeah, there&#8217;s 400 patterns.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:33:06] <strong>Nathan Wrigley:</strong> Yeah, yeah.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:33:07] <strong>Kelly Choyce-Dwan:</strong> So a little different. I don&#8217;t know that there&#8217;s any concrete roadmap for what the future of this directory might look like. There are some discussions about whether there should be different categories, like buttons, columns, taxonomy. There&#8217;s questions about how we should handle patterns that are more for site building versus just content patterns. So I do think that this is all very much still like to be decided, and really if anyone has opinions, I&#8217;m sure we&#8217;d love to hear them.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:33:39] <strong>Nathan Wrigley:</strong> Yeah, we&#8217;ll get onto that actually now because that feels like a good point. So obviously this is being built out in the open. The pair of you have obviously taken a great interest in it, but it may be that people listening to this, this is new to them. And they think that they would like to play with this a little bit, become involved with the team.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>So maybe again, I&#8217;ll direct this one at Kelly first off. Are there any ways, better ways where people can get involved in the project of the directory or the creator? Where are the best places to go and hang out?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:34:12] <strong>Kelly Choyce-Dwan:</strong> If you want to have feedback about the future of the pattern directory or if you just want to report that something&#8217;s not working. The project is on GitHub. It&#8217;s at github.com/wordpress/patterndirectory.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:34:27] <strong>Nathan Wrigley:</strong> So that&#8217;s the best place to go if you wish to find out about becoming involved. Ana, just wondering about your experiences of being involved with this. Have you got any, any insights? Is there a thing that you found the most useful? A, I don&#8217;t know, a Slack channel or a website where people are helping each other out. A group of some kind, maybe a community online somewhere where this is all happening?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:34:50] <strong>Ana Segota:</strong> I was in contact per Slack, with Anne McCartney also and, mostly Slack and Twitter, but yeah, mostly Slack or Github, yeah.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:35:01] <strong>Nathan Wrigley:</strong> Now, I know that neither of you will be able to answer this question directly, but the theme repository and the plugin repository, they feel like there&#8217;s no way that they are going away. They&#8217;re going to be here for the long-term. You know, I can imagine decades from now, they&#8217;ll still be in existence. Do you both have confidence that this journey that we&#8217;ve taken on where blocks and patterns are becoming the new, the new way of creating quick and easy websites. Do you feel confident that this is the way it&#8217;s going to be done? You know, that we ought to sail our ship in this direction?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Your long-term thoughts really on whether or not this is the way it&#8217;s going to be done in the future.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:35:40] <strong>Ana Segota:</strong> I hope so. I really hope so. I think this way is, better way of making, for example, I am in theme business, so, it&#8217;s easier to create themes. Especially to offer easier way of using themes to users. So finally theme can be a design for me, and that&#8217;s a really big step in the right direction. So I really hope it will stay. And also be better with the time and more easier to use.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:36:12] <strong>Nathan Wrigley:</strong> Thank you. And Kelly.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:36:14] <strong>Kelly Choyce-Dwan:</strong> Yeah, I do think that this is the way forward. I think that using blocks and making patterns is really only going to become more, more standard. Easier to use. And so I think that this is going to be the way to make websites</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:36:28] <strong>Nathan Wrigley:</strong> Yeah. Just one last quick thought. I mentioned something similar earlier and Ana talked about it, I&#8217;m going to direct this one at you, Kelly, if that&#8217;s all right. I don&#8217;t know what your experience is with other website building tools. And we mentioned page builders, such as Elementor and, I just wondered what your thoughts are on where the user interface is and the user experience is at the moment.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Maybe you&#8217;ve got some insight into that. Maybe you don&#8217;t, but I just wondered whether you thought that it was yet at a point of maturity. And that kind of ties into the question I&#8217;ve just asked about whether it would be widely adopted, because it feels like there&#8217;s a big holdout of people the moment who simply cannot make the move because the experience as yet doesn&#8217;t have that, it&#8217;s exactly the same on the front end, as it is on the backend. And Ana, I think you just said, Yeah in the background. You can identify. You&#8217;ve committed, you&#8217;ve jumped over and you&#8217;ve made that journey and put the investment of time into&#8230;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:37:24] <strong>Ana Segota:</strong> Yeah, but it takes a lot of challenges, yeah. Because I get the input from the user side and I also used Elementor before to see how it works. And I must say it&#8217;s still a long way. But, what is most confusing now to the users, what I said before, also, those two editors and two different phase. We now have again templates that you can edit.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And they&#8217;re a bit confused. Like, okay, I go on out to edit the template and I saved it and now it&#8217;s applied to all my pages and now you need to explain it that they need to refresh it and pull it back. And it&#8217;s a bit confusing. So we don&#8217;t have one editor where you can do all the things. For example, you come to one editor and click, for example, to choose a layout and this layout is there and you can edit it and that&#8217;s it. Yeah, it&#8217;s a bit struggle for now.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:38:25] <strong>Nathan Wrigley:</strong> I do wonder if that struggle, and I&#8217;m going to see what Kelly makes on this, I do wonder if that&#8217;s going to be for a little while into the future, if that&#8217;s going to be a limitation in terms of adoption, is the fact that there are difficulties. There&#8217;s a lot of learning which needs to take place to wean you off those tools and, whilst the WordPress Core way of doing blocks and patterns and so on is free, widely available, done in the open, open source and all of that kind of stuff. I wonder if the adoption is going to be stifled because of the constraints that Ana just mentioned. What do you think about that?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:39:04] <strong>Ana Segota:</strong> I think it depends also on us, on themers a lot. How we will implement this and make it easier for the users. And we also need to educate now the users, how they can use it and make it as easier as possible. And sometimes there&#8217;s not that easy because you need to follow updates and to do the updates all the time and to educate people about it.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>But I think it&#8217;s a good step in the right direction. And I think with the time and with the education people will adopted it yeah. Just by creating a pages using just block pattern it&#8217;s a really a big step. And it&#8217;s a great thing. You can really create most everything with block patterns without using templates for example.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:39:54] <strong>Nathan Wrigley:</strong> Yeah, I think people just need time, the inspiration to get into it&#8230;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:39:59] <strong>Ana Segota:</strong> It&#8217;s a new, it&#8217;s a new thing and you always need time to learn something new.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:40:03] <strong>Nathan Wrigley:</strong> That&#8217;s right. We actually interviewed Courtney Robertson from the Learn initiative last week. And there&#8217;s an awful lot of content. And I think that&#8217;s maybe a piece that was missing in the past, the ability to go and find video tutorials, which answer the exact question that you&#8217;re looking for.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Kelly, can I put that one to you? Is it basically the same question? You said that you hadn&#8217;t got a great deal of experience with page builders and so on, but I&#8217;m just wondering if you had any intuitions around there, whether or not the UI and the UX is, is everything that you guys had hoped it would be, or do you feel that there&#8217;s still quite a lot of work going through WordPress six and seven and maybe even, eight.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:40:39] <strong>Kelly Choyce-Dwan:</strong> Yeah, I haven&#8217;t used page filters. I am definitely a pretty vanilla WordPress user. But I have been, you know, working with the site editor and I can see that it is a little confusing still. I do think that it needs to be iterated on, but I think that the future is going to be good.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>I think the plans are there and it&#8217;s constantly getting better. So I&#8217;m very positive about it. Yeah.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:41:02] <strong>Nathan Wrigley:</strong> Thank you. Okay, just to wrap up, if people have listened to this podcast today and they would like to get in touch with you and make contact and use your expertise. What&#8217;s the best way of getting in touch with you? It could be a Twitter handle could be an email address, or it could be nothing. You might wish to share nothing at all, but I&#8217;ll start with Ana. What&#8217;s the best way to get in touch with you, Ana?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:41:24] <strong>Ana Segota:</strong> Twitter, or Slack or email. It&#8217;s all good. Maybe you can add a later?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:41:31] <strong>Nathan Wrigley:</strong> Yeah, I will definitely add your Twitter and Slack into the show notes. And same question to you, Kelly.

Between all of that, <strong><a href=\"https://developer.woocommerce.com/2022/05/10/woocommerce-blocks-7-6-0-release-notes/\">WooCommerce Blocks 7.6</a> </strong>was also released.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Over on <strong>Do the Woo</strong>, we had <a href=\"https://dothewoo.io/the-woocommerce-roundtable-dives-into-wordpress-6-0/\">a conversation about the upcoming release</a> of <strong>WordPress 6.0</strong>. The <strong>Woo Roundtable</strong>, consisting of <strong>Ronald Gijse</strong>l, <strong>Robbie Adair</strong>, <strong>Robert Jacobi</strong>, and <strong>Tammie Lister</strong> dove in to offer some insights about 6.0 and how WooCommerce plays into it. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Then <strong>Ronnie Burt</strong> from <strong>Sensei LMS</strong> and <strong>Automattic</strong> shared his extensive experience in the wider education space and his journey to move into the WordPress ecosystem, and LMS space:</p>\n\n\n\n<blockquote class=\"wp-block-quote\"><p>&#8220;And so when I think about democratizing education, I think about how do we help [provide] the best content [so the] best learning experiences bubble to the top and be found.&#8221;</p></blockquote>\n\n\n\n<p>A little bird told me about <a href=\"https://poststatus.com/the-state-of-wordpress-market-share/\">a drop in the WordPress market share</a>.

Sometimes this comes with a cost. It’s no secret that WordPress has a bad reputation when it comes to development. It has a lot of legacy baggage and die-hard rules that prevent any backward compatibility breaking change when it comes to PHP code (Gutenberg is another story I won’t get into).</p>\n\n\n\n<p>That legacy PHP code is often used by the developers that are starting to enter the world of programming, and the issue with that is they can learn some bad programming patterns. That in turn means they will reuse the poorly written code, increasing the amount of bad code in the world.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>This is where WordPress gets its bad reputation in the developer community.</p>\n\n\n\n<h3><strong>Breaking the cycle</strong></h3>\n\n\n\n<p>So how can we break this cycle of bad code? By teaching new developers how they should write good code. One example of teaching new developers (but also old ones that are still clinging to the ‘WordPress’ way of doing things) is by writing tutorials.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Another way is to encourage them to use tools that can help them write better code.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>I’m currently involved in the work which aims to release the new version of the <a href=\"https://github.com/WordPress/WordPress-Coding-Standards/\">WordPress Coding Standards</a>, a set of rules used for the <a href=\"https://github.com/squizlabs/PHP_CodeSniffer/\">PHP_CodeSniffer</a> tool that will let you know if your code has some potential issues (security, best practices, code style).</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Another tool that I’ve recently developed is a <a href=\"https://github.com/dingo-d/wp-pest-integration-test-setup\">package</a> that will help developers set up WordPress integration tests that use the <a href=\"https://pestphp.com\">Pest</a> testing framework.</p>\n\n\n\n<h3><strong>Ok, so why do we need this new tool?</strong></h3>\n\n\n\n<p>The main motivation behind creating this package is to encourage more people to write tests for their code, especially plugin developers.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>A lot of developers in the WordPress community go with the mantra: I can see that it works because I’ve tried it out in my browser. That’s OK, but there are issues with that.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>First, it’s time-consuming. Every time you make some change, you need to make sure it works, but also that you didn’t break anything.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Second, people make mistakes. We are not foolproof, and code may be misused in ways you never thought possible. You would be amazed at how creative people can be when writing code.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Automated tests are quick and can help you in testing various cases that will happen when you execute your code.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>You test for the intended behavior (happy path), and in a quick way, you can add examples of how your code can be used in a way you didn’t intend it to be used (unhappy path).</p>\n\n\n\n<p>It also safeguards your code from regressions. A code regression is when you unintentionally break one part of your code by adding new code.</p>\n\n\n\n<h3><strong>The problem with tests set up so far</strong></h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Testing in WordPress is not a new thing. And it’s not like you couldn’t set up tests for your code before. There are amazing libraries out there that will help you set everything up like <a href=\"https://wpbrowser.wptestkit.dev/\">wp-browser</a>.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>But the problem is that the setup procedure is often clunky.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>You need to set up a separate database for tests, and you need to run certain scripts, then change files to make it all work.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Let’s face it, it’s not a straightforward thing to do, and developers are by nature lazy creatures (that’s why we write code to do things for us <img src=\"https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/13.1.0/72x72/1f604.png\" alt=\"😄\" class=\"wp-smiley\" />).</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The aim of the wp-pest integration test setup is to eliminate all that extra work.</p>\n\n\n\n<h3><strong>How to set it up</strong></h3>\n\n\n\n<p>In order to set it up, your project must use <a href=\"https://getcomposer.org/\">Composer</a>. It’s a de-facto standard way of adding packages to your code.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>In your terminal type</p>\n\n\n\n<pre class=\"wp-block-code\"><code>composer require dingo-d/wp-pest-integration-test-setup --dev</code></pre>\n\n\n\n<p>After you’ve downloaded the package and its dependencies you can set up the theme tests by typing</p>\n\n\n\n<pre class=\"wp-block-code\"><code>vendor/bin/wp-pest setup theme</code></pre>\n\n\n\n<p>Or, in the case you want to set up tests for your plugin, you can write</p>\n\n\n\n<pre class=\"wp-block-code\"><code>vendor/bin/wp-pest setup plugin --plugin-slug=your-plugin-slug</code></pre>\n\n\n\n<p>Optionally, you can provide a <code>--wp-version</code> parameter, to specify which WordPress version you&#8217;d like to test your code on.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>In the background, a WordPress instance will be downloaded, and an in-memory database will be set up, along with two examples of tests that you can run.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Then, running either</p>\n\n\n\n<pre class=\"wp-block-code\"><code>vendor/bin/pest --group=unit</code></pre>\n\n\n\n<p>or</p>\n\n\n\n<pre class=\"wp-block-code\"><code>vendor/bin/pest --group=integration</code></pre>\n\n\n\n<p>will run the tests.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The beauty of Pest is that its syntax is developer-friendly. It has <a href=\"https://pestphp.com/docs/installation\">amazing documentation</a> and great syntax. Let’s look at a simple example. Say you are registering a custom post type called &#8216;Books&#8217;:</p>\n\n\n\n<pre class=\"wp-block-code\"><code>&lt;?php\n\n/**\n * Plugin Name: Test plugin\n * Desctiption: Test plugin\n * Version: 1.0.0\n * License: MIT\n */\n\nfunction test_plugin_register_books_cpt() {\n    $args = array(\n        \'label\'              =&gt; esc_html__( \'Books\', \'test-plugin\' ),\n        \'public\'             =&gt; true,\n        \'publicly_queryable\' =&gt; true,\n        \'show_ui\'            =&gt; true,\n        \'show_in_menu\'       =&gt; true,\n        \'query_var\'          =&gt; true,\n        \'rewrite\'            =&gt; array( \'slug\' =&gt; \'book\' ),\n        \'capability_type\'    =&gt; \'post\',\n        \'has_archive\'        =&gt; true,\n        \'hierarchical\'       =&gt; false,\n        \'menu_position\'      =&gt; null,\n        \'supports\'           =&gt; array( \'title\', \'editor\', \'author\', \'thumbnail\', \'excerpt\', \'comments\' ),\n    );\n \n    register_post_type( \'book\', $args );\n}\n \nadd_action( \'init\', \'test_plugin_register_books_cpt\' );\n</code></pre>\n\n\n\n<p>After running the setup command that adds an example, a test called <code>BooksCptTest.php</code> would look like this:</p>\n\n\n\n<pre class=\"wp-block-code\"><code>&lt;?php\n\nnamespace Tests\\Integration;\n\nbeforeEach(function () {\n	parent::setUp();\n});\n\nafterEach(function () {\n	parent::tearDown();\n});\n\ntest(\'Books custom post type is registered\', function () {\n	// We can use assertions from PHP_Unit.\n	$this-&gt;assertNotFalse(has_action(\'init\', \'test_plugin_register_books_cpt\'));\n\n	$registeredPostTypes = \\get_post_types();\n\n	// Or we can use expectations API from Pest.\n	expect($registeredPostTypes)\n		-&gt;toBeArray()\n		-&gt;toHaveKey(\'book\');\n});\n</code></pre>\n\n\n\n<p>Running <code>vendor/bin/pest --group=integration</code> gives us the following output:</p>\n\n\n\n<pre class=\"wp-block-code\"><code>Installing...\nRunning as single site... To run multisite, use -c tests/phpunit/multisite.xml\nNot running ajax tests. To execute these, use --group ajax.\nNot running ms-files tests. To execute these, use --group ms-files.\nNot running external-http tests. To execute these, use --group external-http.\n\n   PASS  Tests\\\\Integration\\\\BooksCptTest\n  ✓ Books custom post type is registered\n\n  Tests:  1 passed\n  Time:   0.14s</code></pre>\n\n\n\n<h3><strong>Conclusion</strong></h3>\n\n\n\n<p>And just like that, you have the ability to run WordPress integration tests in your theme or plugin. Tests are amazing because not only are they safeguarding us from mistakes, but they also force us to write clean and testable code. This is especially true for plugins that have complicated logic or are communicating with third-party APIs.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Writing tests for such a codebase will force you to think about what your code architecture looks like so you can easily write automated tests &#8211; not to mention the time and money you’ll save from not having to manually test everything.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>If you think this is something you might benefit from, feel free to use it, and <a href=\"https://github.com/dingo-d/wp-pest-integration-test-setup\">star the repository</a> on GitHub.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Hopefully, this will encourage more WordPress developers to use tools that will enhance their coding skills.</p>\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:7:\"pubDate\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:31:\"Tue, 17 May 2022 18:25:19 +0000\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}s:32:\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\";a:1:{s:7:\"creator\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:13:\"Denis Žoljom\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}}}i:20;a:6:{s:4:\"data\";s:13:\"\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";s:5:\"child\";a:2:{s:0:\"\";a:5:{s:5:\"title\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:125:\"WPTavern: Online Meetup: WordPress NYC to Host Series on Modern, Privacy-Respecting Analytics and Leveraging First-Party Data\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"guid\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:30:\"https://wptavern.com/?p=134464\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"link\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:134:\"https://wptavern.com/online-meetup-wordpress-nyc-to-host-series-on-modern-privacy-respecting-analytics-and-leveraging-first-party-data\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:11:\"description\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:3125:\"<p>One of the positive effects of the COVID-19 pandemic is local meetups are more frequently broadcasting their events online, giving people outside the immediate area the opportunity to attend and learn new skills. <a href=\"https://www.meetup.com/find/?keywords=wordpress&source=EVENTS&eventType=online&sortField=DATETIME\">Searching meetup.com for WordPress</a>, filtered to show Online Events, will show upcoming events that anyone can attend.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>WordPress NYC is hosting an interesting new six-part series on analytics beginning this week on Thursday, May 19, at 7PM EDT. Co-organizer Victor Ramirez will kick it off with a workshop titled &#8220;The Product &amp; Marketing Data Landscape.&#8221; Attendees will get an overview of  the current WordPress analytics landscape.

The county sits at the southernmost point of state, with a declining population of <a href=\"https://www.census.gov/quickfacts/mcdowellcountywestvirginia\">18,363</a> and a median household income of $27,682. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>In the 1950&#8217;s, at the apex of the mining industry&#8217;s economic influence, McDowell County had close to 100,000 people living there. They mined the coal that built much of the infrastructure for American cities. After the industry became more mechanized and many left to find work elsewhere, the community began to deteriorate, drugs got a foothold, and many local kids are now raised by their grandparents. Property taxes evaporated, as a large number of homes are on homestead exemption, which further lowers property taxes for those who are 65+ or considered disabled.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The Welch News remains in the county as a unifying force that the dwindling populace relies on to stay connected and informed. Publisher Melissa Nester often says she learned how to read by reading the Welch News. Three years ago, she purchased her local newspaper to keep it from shuttering. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>&#8220;Our previous owner made the decision to close the newspaper at a point we felt we were going strong,&#8221; Nester said. &#8220;Revenue had declined along with the business population we used to support our operation over the years, however we felt it was an asset to community building and wanted to use it as such.&#8221; &nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<img />The Welch News Publisher Melissa Nestor &#8211; photo credit: The Welch News\n\n\n\n<p>Nester purchased the paper, with the promised support of her core team members at the time. Most of them are still working with her today.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>“The Welch News had been a staple in all our lives,&#8221; Nester said. &#8220;When we announced that we would cease to print, the community was outraged. We cried with customers stopping in to see us one last time, most of them sharing stories of their first job being a paper carrier at the newspaper. One of our carriers at the time told us the story of an elderly woman who said all she had at home was a landline phone and The Welch News. It’s all she had. We were absolutely floored as we heard how much our community wanted us to remain.&#8221;</p>\n\n\n\n<h3>The Welch News Launches a Digital Publication on WordPress with the Help of the PaywallProject</h3>\n\n\n\n<img />photo credit &#8211; The PaywallProject\n\n\n\n<p>After purchasing the paper, Nester held a meeting on May 8, 2018, where she invited everyone she could think of to help her plan a path to move forward. Tyler Channell, creator of the <a href=\"https://www.paywallproject.com/\">PaywallProject</a>, attended this meeting and listened to the team&#8217;s goals and concerns.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>&#8220;Building simple WordPress-based sites for various businesses is something I&#8217;ve done dating back to 2008,&#8221; Channell said. &#8220;I really started focusing on local newspaper web development in late 2017 after graduate school (journalism) at West Virginia University.&#8221;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Channell began helping local West Virginian newspapers, after they reached out with specific questions about generating revenue from their publications.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>&#8220;Digital ads weren&#8217;t cutting it for them (a similar story I hear from publishers across the country),&#8221; Channell said. &#8220;With Facebook and Google owning virtually the entire digital ad market, newspapers must focus their efforts on generating paid digital subscriptions to remain sustainable. People are willing to pay for local content that they can&#8217;t get anywhere else.&#8221;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>After helping his first local newspaper find success with a paywall he implemented, he decided to put together a simple ready-to-go website solution focused on growing paid digital subscribers for local newspapers across West Virginia and beyond. He now has approximately 20 local newspapers signed on to the PaywallProject&#8217;s services. The all-in-one subscription platform for local news costs $199/month and includes website development, a flexible paywall subscription platform with no transaction fees, migration, and built-in ad management.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>&#8220;I use a number of different themes/plugin-based solutions combined with custom code, payments via Stripe, and hosting through DigitalOcean to bring it all together,&#8221; Channell said. &#8220;The goal for me is to provide all technical aspects so that local news publishers can focus on publishing content.&#8221;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>For many small publishers, this is their very first website. Channell said his clients are quick to acclimate to WordPress.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>&#8220;I think when you remove the technical aspects of digital subscriptions, it reduces the learning curve dramatically,&#8221; he said.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>&#8220;Growing digital subscriptions takes a lot of time and effort. But with each new paid subscriber a newspaper brings on board, local journalism becomes that much more sustainable.&#8221;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The Welch News&#8217; WordPress site helped put the publication on a path to sustainability. Within the first ten days of launching their digital edition, they gained 100 new subscribers, and subscriptions keep rolling in from local residents and people all over the country.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>“I believe [Channell] was particularly interested when he learned our newsroom was staffed by millennials who cared deeply about the community they live in and hoped to make a positive change,&#8221; Nester said. &#8220;He realized our staff could easily transition.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>&#8220;As publisher/owner, at 56 years old, I have probably been the person hardest to train on using the site, but even I am very comfortable posting articles without help.&#8221;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Welch News Editor Derek Tyson is the primary person writing and editing articles, approving submissions, and managing ad design and layout for the front page.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>“We really enjoy the ease of access WordPress offers,&#8221; Tyson said. &#8220;I think we all were quite surprised how easy it was to put our articles into the digital format to share with the world at large. The transition wasn’t hard. Changing our office routine after over 90 years of only print publishing was by far the hardest part.  PaywallProject made this transition easy for us.  Trainings happened in our own newsroom, and PaywallProject has always available to help with any issues.”</p>\n\n\n\n<img />The Welch News Editor Derek Tyson &#8211; photo credit: The Welch News\n\n\n\n<p>The entire publication process is still very much a labor of love, as is evident in this video the PaywallProject created featuring The Welch News. The team managing it is far younger than most of the town but fiercely dedicated to keeping this vital community resource going.</p>\n\n\n\n<div>\n<blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\"><p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\">Growing paid digital subscriptions in rural Appalachia is possible! <a href=\"https://twitter.com/nestergirl2?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">@nestergirl2</a> <a href=\"https://twitter.com/thatdamntyson?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">@thatdamntyson</a> <a href=\"https://t.co/rpOE8fUEqM\">pic.twitter.com/rpOE8fUEqM</a></p>&mdash; PaywallProject (@paywallproject) <a href=\"https://twitter.com/paywallproject/status/1523755491683631104?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">May 9, 2022</a></blockquote>\n</div>\n\n\n\n<p>“Putting ourselves out into the digital world was both exciting and terrifying,&#8221; Nester said. &#8220;We were skeptical about our content being capable of generating online subscriptions. But it was the best case of being proven wrong in our lives.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>“It does sometimes feel unnerving to move from a local publication that is only read via print media in your community, to a publication with a far greater reach.  Sometimes that brings forth &#8216;internet warriors&#8217; to criticize, as well as &#8216;internet warriors&#8217; to support.  PaywallProject is knowledgeable in the field of journalism, and that makes a great difference.&#8221;</p>\n\n\n\n<h3>The Welch News Still Prints and Delivers the Paper Three Days Per Week</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>The Welch News is just one of hundreds of publications that have <a href=\"https://wptavern.com/finding-wordpress-in-the-post-print-news-era\">found WordPress in the post-print news era</a>, but unlike many others who transitioned to purely digital publishing, they are committed to keeping their print version going on their 1966 model printing press. They print three days a week and offer home delivery within McDowell County, as well as mail delivery across the nation.</p>\n\n\n\n\n<img />\n\n\n\n<img />\n\n\n\n<img />\n\n\n\n\n<p>&#8220;We have a high population of elderly residents, and strongly feel that they need the connection with the home delivery drivers three times each week,&#8221; Nester said. &#8220;We understand this isn’t the greatest business model, and often hear the advice to move to a weekly publication. Our desire to serve our residents in the best way possible keeps us headstrong about a three-day print publication.&#8221;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Though nearly everyone from his generation has moved away from the area, Tyson&#8217;s commitment to serve The Welch News&#8217; elderly subscribers burns strong.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>&#8220;We&#8217;re here to serve a very vulnerable population that I feel like the modern world is pretty quick to sweep under the rug,&#8221; Tyson said in a recent <a href=\"https://vimeo.com/495924832/492e92a96f\">documentary</a> about the county. &#8220;I see elderly people suffer, feeling like they&#8217;re not important and nobody needs them anymore. That&#8217;s just awful. They&#8217;re not as strong, they move a little slow, they&#8217;ll talk your head off but they&#8217;re living human beings that matter, and I&#8217;m going to fight for them.&#8221;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Local news stands as a guardian for small, economically vulnerable counties like McDowell. In an area that is frequently cited among the five poorest counties in the US, the people still have their own voice through The Welch News. This publication finding sustainability is like a flower growing up through the concrete.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>As we witness the slow death of the American newspaper, these little newspapers staying alive to keep the public informed offer a ray of hope. Small publications continue to contend with <a href=\"https://wptavern.com/more-than-200-local-newspaper-publishers-are-suing-google-and-facebook-for-damages\">the greed and corruption of the advertising industry</a>, tech giants that have <a href=\"https://wptavern.com/amp-has-irreparably-damaged-publishers-trust-in-google-led-initiatives\">willfully eroded publishers&#8217; trust </a>through collusion and manipulation of the digital ad market. With affordable publishing tools like WordPress, The Welch News and its contemporaries can have a fighting chance.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>&#8220;This is very much a heart project to serve and better our community, and we aren&#8217;t sure how long we can sustain it,&#8221; Nester said. &#8220;I&#8217;m certain we wouldn&#8217;t have survived the income loss from COVID without our website. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>&#8220;I often say I quit my job every morning, but go anyway. I quit again by nightfall, and the email comes showing the income from online subscriptions and I decide to try again.&#8221; </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Tyson and his small team of journalists believe the best hope for keeping local news alive, when many small outlets have shuttered or consolidated, is maintaing a hyperlocal focus.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>“Our strategy has been to shift our content priorities from broad coverage to a hyperlocal focus on issues within McDowell County’s borders,&#8221; he said. &#8220;With so many forms of media coverage available today, we decided to focus on what you couldn’t find anywhere else and in turn, showing that important things happen in small towns that deserve media attention.&#8221;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>WordPress and the PaywallProject helped introduce a new stream of revenue for their century-old business. As the subscriptions continued to flow in, Nester said they realized &#8220;hyperlocal content did indeed have true value and would not be found anywhere else.&#8221; It&#8217;s one of the reasons <a href=\"https://www.poynter.org/business-work/2022/the-pulitzers-still-value-opinion-writing-and-so-do-readers/\">many of the 2022 Pulizter prize winners have won for local stories</a> that would never be covered in the larger news market.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>“Citizens near and far should understand the need to fund local newsrooms, and the important work they do,&#8221; Nester said. &#8220;Understanding that without supporting local journalists, a large sense of community will be lost with each news desert that comes.  If newsrooms are funded through community support, it is a better representation of that community and a means to bring forward local issues for resolution.&#8221;</p>\n\n\n\n<p></p>\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:7:\"pubDate\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:31:\"Mon, 16 May 2022 15:16:18 +0000\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}s:32:\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\";a:1:{s:7:\"creator\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:13:\"Sarah Gooding\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}}}i:24;a:6:{s:4:\"data\";s:13:\"\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";s:5:\"child\";a:2:{s:0:\"\";a:5:{s:5:\"title\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:147:\"WordPress.org blog: WP Briefing: Episode 31: Open Source &amp; Accessibility– Celebrating Global Accessibility Awareness Day With Guest Joe Devon\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"guid\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:53:\"https://wordpress.org/news/?post_type=podcast&p=12855\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"link\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:140:\"https://wordpress.org/news/2022/05/episode-31-open-source-accessibility-celebrating-global-accessibility-awareness-day-with-guest-joe-devon/\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:11:\"description\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:33186:\"<p>In the thirty-first episode of the WordPress Briefing, GAAD Co-Founder Joe Devon joins WordPress Executive Director Josepha Haden Chomphosy to discuss Global Accessibility Awareness Day and the role of open source in accessibility. </p>\n\n\n\n<p><em><strong>Have a question you&#8217;d like answered?

And welcome to the WordPress Briefing. The podcast where you can catch quick explanations of the ideas behind the WordPress open source project, some insight into the community that supports it, and get a small list of big things coming up in the next two weeks. I&#8217;m your host Josepha Haden Chomphosy. Here we go!</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[<strong>Josepha Haden Chomphosy </strong>00:00:40]&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Y&#8217;all, we&#8217;ve got an absolutely jam-packed couple of weeks in WordPress. We&#8217;ve got events happening and releases shipping and contributor days being coordinated (I almost said contributor days being contributed). That&#8217;s also what they&#8217;re doing. I&#8217;ll share some of those highlights in today&#8217;s small list of big things, but I did want to specifically call out something that&#8217;s coming up this week on Thursday (May 19, 2022), and that something is Global Accessibility Awareness Day.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The team of contributors over on the Accessibility team has participated in the Global Accessibility Awareness Day in the past. So I thought it would be interesting to hear from one of the co-founders of this particular day of awareness.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[<strong>Josepha Haden Chomphosy </strong>00:01:27]&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>All right. And with that, Joe Devin, would you like to tell us a little bit more about yourself?&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>[Joe Devon 00:01:34] </strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>Sure. So I am the co-founder of Global Accessibility Awareness Day, which is a day that goes viral every year on the third Thursday of May. We typically have the Twitter reach on the GAAD hashtag on Twitter of 200 million users, which is, I think, pretty much their active user count. We stopped counting once we hit their daily active user count. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>And then, I am Chair of the GAAD Foundation, which we launched last year. And then I have a day job too, where I&#8217;m CEO and co-founder of Diamond, which is an inclusive digital agency that builds software accessibly by default. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>[<strong>Josepha Haden Chomphosy </strong>00:02:15]&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Wonderful. Well, we are so excited to have you today. I said we like it&#8217;s me and the mouse in my pocket—we in the WordPress community that&#8217;s going to listen to this. Super excited to have you today. So you mentioned GAAD, Global Accessibility Awareness Day. Last year was your 10th anniversary, which is very exciting, but like with so many good things, I hear it all started with a blog post and a blog post on WordPress, no less.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>So I&#8217;d love to hear about how GAAD evolved from that, with, as I understand it, your co-founder of Jennison (Asuncion). That must be where you met him, I assume.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>[Joe Devon 00:02:51] </strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>Yes. Yes. So what happened was I started a WordPress blog called <em>My SQL Talk</em>. So it&#8217;s a database blog, and I just thought it was a brilliant name. I mean, My SQL Talk, like that, should be super popular.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And it probably had maybe ten people who ever looked. Um, and then my dad was getting older, and my dad was a survivor of the concentration camps, and he was a genius. He spoke ten languages. It, he was one of those people. That, when he walked into a room, he just commanded respect. You knew that there was history. I don&#8217;t know how to explain it really, but it was special when my dad walked into the room. And considering all of this that he suffered in his life, watching him get older and struggle, particularly with his banking, was very painful to see. And the bank wasn&#8217;t accessible, so I wrote this blog post proposing that we create a Global Accessibility Awareness Day.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Sometimes I get these visions, and they never turn into anything. But while I think about it, I&#8217;m like, &#8220;all right, let&#8217;s write this blog post and this can definitely work. Right?&#8221; And then you finish the blog post to hit send, and you&#8217;re like, &#8220;this is not going to work.&#8221;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>But I wasn&#8217;t even smart enough to do social media on it. But fortunately, WordPress had an auto-tweet feature, and it tweeted it out, and Jennison Asuncion, my co-founder, happened to be around and not out that Saturday night. And he read the blog post, and he said, &#8220;this is a great idea. Let&#8217;s make it happen.&#8221;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And we had two busy people, but we both had a community. He had the accessibility community, and I was building a tech scene in Los Angeles. And what I discovered is if you combine a great idea with the community, great things can happen. </p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>[Josepha Haden Chomphosy 00:04:49]</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>Oh man, you&#8217;re speaking my language over here, helping people find their communities, knowing that community is the thing that is the lifeblood of society.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>That sounded like a tautology. It is not a tautology. You can have a society with an attempt to not have any sort of community around it, but I bet it doesn&#8217;t work very well. Well, that&#8217;s, that&#8217;s very interesting. And so you all just kind of talked through what that would look like, I assume in confidence, or that would have to take place, right? Or was it on Twitter in those days?&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>[Joe Devon 00:05:24]</strong> </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Oh, you could still look in the comments and see the back and forth of Jennison and a bunch of other people that got pretty involved with GAAD that are some legendary folks in there. It&#8217;s kind of mind-blowing because I dunno how, how you feel, but for me, when I used to code, uh, three months later, I&#8217;d look back at old code and be like, &#8220;oh, I suck,&#8221; you know, or write an email even and you look back on it a day later and are like &#8220;what a stupid email, how stupid am I?&#8221; You know?  But I look back on that one after ten years; I was scared to look at it because I&#8217;m like, it must&#8217;ve been really bad. But you know, it kind of held up, and exactly what I wrote in there happened &#8211; to my utter shock.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>[Josepha Haden Chomphosy 00:06:06]</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>But also, it&#8217;s kinda nice, though, to look back and be like, &#8220;oh, I used to be much dumber.&#8221;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Cause then you&#8217;re like, look how far I&#8217;ve come. I&#8217;m no longer that dumb. I&#8217;m a different kind of dumb now; good for me. I always hope to be a different kind of dumb as I go forward. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>So then, okay, so that was your ten-year anniversary last year. GAAD, in general, now has been going on for 11 years, and at the time of this recording, in a couple of weeks, but then probably a week when it finally publishes, you have your next, your next round of that going.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>I think it seems safe to assume that awareness of the need for accessibility has increased during that time, but we all know that the work of accessibility is ongoing. And so, I&#8217;m just curious to hear from your perspective if the awareness of the need for accessibility has generally started to permeate developer communities.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And are you seeing more developer awareness around the need for accessibility in tech in general?&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>[Joe Devon 00:07:12]</strong> </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Yeah. You know, it&#8217;s not enough. It&#8217;s certainly improved a lot.  I keynoted a conference probably four years after GAAD started, maybe five, and I kind of assumed nobody would have heard of accessibility, and I was taken aback when I asked who had heard of it, and a good chunk of the room had. So even then, there had been a difference, and I&#8217;d say now I see accessibility mentioned a lot more in conferences and stuff. But when it comes to actually building it, there&#8217;s a tremendous amount of ignorance. There, there still needs to be a lot more awareness.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And I think partially people are a little bit scared to dip their toe because they&#8217;re scared that they&#8217;re going to be told that &#8220;no, it&#8217;s not accessible,&#8221; or that they&#8217;re going to say the wrong word or offend somebody. So I&#8217;d say that there&#8217;s some degree of trepidation, but also developers, and it&#8217;s not just developers, designers, and product people. There&#8217;s so much to learn, and it&#8217;s like, &#8220;oh God, there&#8217;s another piece that I have to learn.&#8221; </p>\n\n\n\n<p>And I&#8217;m so glad that you invited me on this podcast because it&#8217;s the developers that, you know, I am a developer, not anymore, I haven&#8217;t touched code in years, but that&#8217;s where I came from. Right? This is my peach, right? Particularly WordPress folks, because I had done a fair bit of WordPress before I moved on to some other things. And, I think we have to talk about usability and understand that accessibility is so much more than how we look at disability.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And if you don&#8217;t mind, I&#8217;m going to ask you a question. How do you think the typical WordPress developer or designer would define disability? </p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>[Josepha Haden Chomphosy 00:09:05] </strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>in the kinds of conversations that I&#8217;ve had over the years, it frequently has to do with visual things. Because it&#8217;s just screens all day, right? And that&#8217;s a primary area where our designers and developers really have made some effort.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>But my personal favorite sort of, of example, for like, when you&#8217;re looking at how to make sure that your products are accessible is, what, if you have to use your website, or you have to build your website using only one arm. Because that gives you an opportunity to kind of look at disability from a permanent standpoint.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Like if you have lost permanent use of one arm, but also gives you an opportunity to look at the temporary options for that sort of lack of mobility. Like you&#8217;re a mother with an infant, and so you have to be able to, you know, get your stuff done with one arm. And so I know that we paid a bunch of attention to screen readers and what works in not way back in 2018 and 2019 did a lot of work with. Literally zero screen. And can you still do the thing that you need to do, which was incredibly difficult. And I was really excited to see what our developers came up with around that. But I think that that is quite a bit of that discussion as we&#8217;re going through it from the beginning to the&nbsp;end.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>[Joe Devon 00:10:27] </strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>Yeah. I mean, that&#8217;s a great answer, and you definitely understand some of the nuances way better than I think that the average creator, digital product creator, I&#8217;m including the, you know, the product people, the designers, and the developers.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>[Josepha Haden Chomphosy 00:10:42] </strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>We&#8217;re very fortunate to have more than just developers in WordPress.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>[Joe Devon 00:10:50]  </strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>The reason I bring this up is that the WHO (World Health Organization) had to; they&#8217;re the ones that did massive research across the globe. And they had to, they had to come up with a definition, and in their definition, they needed to draw a line. Typically, I don&#8217;t remember the exact thing cause it&#8217;s a 350-page report, and I kept looking for where they defined it again.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>It was a little hard to find, but essentially it&#8217;s if there&#8217;s a major disability or a disability that impacts some significant portion of your day-to-day activities. And that&#8217;s really great when you&#8217;re trying to do a report on how many disabilities there are out there; what percentage of the population has a disability?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And their figures are something like 15% of the population has a disability, which is a huge number. But at the same time, they also mentioned that 2.2 billion people have a visual impairment. And we also know that over 33% of the population is over 50, and I&#8217;m included in that population. And I can say that when you&#8217;re over 50, you know, I&#8217;ve got clouds in my eyes.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>I don&#8217;t know where they came from, but they definitely make it harder to see. When I&#8217;m in a restaurant, I can&#8217;t focus on the person across from me the same way. My hearing is not the same, and anybody over 50 is going to have certain impairments and won&#8217;t see as well; color contrast issues are a big deal.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Being able to raise the font is a big deal. And I think that accessibility is connected in most people&#8217;s minds with disability. And they&#8217;ll attach that to something like being blind or being deaf or hard of hearing or having a missing limb or having some other kind of disability. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>And, as a result, they&#8217;re like, &#8220;well, I don&#8217;t even know any people in that category possibly,&#8221; and as a result, they&#8217;re like, &#8220;well, how important is this?&#8221; Yes. They might feel guilty. I should do the right thing. This is the right thing to do. But honestly, like how much money should I spend on it? How much, what percentage of my time should I spend on it?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And it&#8217;s because they don&#8217;t realize that everybody has different abilities. And so, I&#8217;m starting to go away from even talking about disabilities and asking people to remember that all of us perceive things differently. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Do you remember the gold dress where they were trying to say, what color is this dress? Is it gold and white or blue and black? And it is blue and black, but to me, all I see is gold and white. And then there was Laurel or Yanny. Do you remember that?. And some people heard it, and typically older people heard it as Laurel, and I&#8217;ve, and I do this in some of my presentations. I play that, that sound. And usually, it&#8217;s Laurel for me, but sometimes it&#8217;s Yanny. Even personally, it changes. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>And so, we have a totally different perception. Now think about memory. There&#8217;s a different kind of blindness. If you try and remember, let&#8217;s say a relative or a friend that is no longer. How well do you see that picture?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Because for me, it is very, very vague, but for some people, they say, and I&#8217;ve been asking people, and I&#8217;d love your answer as well. How vivid is it? And some people say, I can read the, I can see the pattern on the shirt. It&#8217;s as vivid as if I see with opening my eyes, seeing, you know, the regular in front of me, and I can even read a name tag in the memory.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And I&#8217;m like, Woah, so maybe I&#8217;m blind in a way. Right? So how do you see it? How do you remember things?&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>[Josepha Haden Chomphosy 00:14:42] </strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>Oh, I&#8217;m a, I&#8217;m a real visual person and a tactile person. And so, like if I interacted with someone, I&#8217;m very likely to be able to picture, like, recreate that mental picture pretty well in my mind. I recently, very recently, met some of my first people in that executive leadership space who were like, yeah, I don&#8217;t, I don&#8217;t visualize things.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And I was like, what are you, how do you do this work? Because like, you have to be able to do that. And they were like, no, I don&#8217;t have mental pictures.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>[Joe Devon 00:15:13] </strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>Some people don&#8217;t have an inner dialogue.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>[Josepha Haden Chomphosy 00:15:17] </strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>I don&#8217;t understand that either,&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>[Joe Devon 00:15:19] </strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>Me either. So accessibility studies all of these differences with respect to how you&#8217;re presenting all of this information.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And if you don&#8217;t pay attention to accessibility, you&#8217;re really just missing out. And then there&#8217;s colorblindness. If you&#8217;re creating something like slack that has an online/offline indicator, and you only use red and green for people who are colorblind, they see gray and gray. And so what I&#8217;m trying to teach the community with digital product creators is that no, you cannot ignore it.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>You can ignore accessibility, but then you&#8217;re not good at your job. I mean, I don&#8217;t mean to say it in an offensive way, but you&#8217;re not good at your job if you&#8217;re unaware. If you break a rule on purpose, great. But if you don&#8217;t know the rule, it&#8217;s just a lack of craft, and you absolutely should make it a priority.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And you&#8217;re not doing it as a charity. You&#8217;re doing it because you care about your users, and you care about your craft, and you want to build things well, and it&#8217;s a necessity. And I think that this is the kind of message that our community needs to hear.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>[Josepha Haden Chomphosy 00:16:31]</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>I want to touch on something that you sort of brought up a bit, um, at the start of the answer there.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>So you brought up the concept of usability. And in the last time that I did a podcast about accessibility, I defined accessibility as a subset of usability. Do you think that if we were to consistently draw that line for people so that it&#8217;s not just like accessibility is this thing that you should do outside of usability?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>If we were to more consistently draw that line, do you think that that would help people to see and understand better that its shades of existence, usability, and accessibility?  &nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>[Joe Devon 00:17:10] </strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>Oh, 100%, a hundred percent. And in my company, we kind of realized that that&#8217;s exactly what we have to do. We have to see this as usability.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And I don&#8217;t, we talk about accessibility a lot, but I don&#8217;t want to. It&#8217;s part of the plumbing for us. We&#8217;ve made it part of the plumbing, and I can tell you it&#8217;s a struggle to take accessibility and make it part of an organization, even when you&#8217;re bringing it top-down, believe it or not. For our teams, particularly the designers, they are blown away by what they&#8217;re learning because they&#8217;re improving their craft.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And design is typically where there&#8217;s a struggle to get accessibility accepted because there seems to be a very strong idea of what a design should look like. And I think it&#8217;s really about the approach because UX and design it&#8217;s all about empathy for people. And when you approach it, not as, even though empathy should mean that, that, you know, do the right thing at the same time, it&#8217;s more about empathy for your user, and your user includes so much more than just people with disabilities that you haven&#8217;t run into somebody that has that disability and therefore you build it better, and it&#8217;s, it&#8217;s completely blown their mind. They love it. They love doing it. And I&#8217;m not hiring people with accessibility coming in. We&#8217;re training them to work accessibly. </p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>[Josepha Haden Chomphosy 00:18:34] </strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>So I think it&#8217;s interesting that you talk about empathy as part of being able to make sure that you&#8217;re creating something that&#8217;s accessible because I actually feel like empathy is. Like it&#8217;s being considered this gold standard for many, many things right now. And I think it actually is more harmful in the long run than instead making altruistic choices.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And so, I have a blog post that I will link in our show notes that will kind of help everybody see more fully my concept there. But when you rely on empathy, you do kind of have to rely on one, being able to run into all of the issues you were mentioning. You have to know people who have problems in order to know that the problems exist.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And then you also kind of have to assume that once you have willingly put yourself into the discomfort of that kind of disability, whatever, wherever it exists on that spectrum, your experience of that discomfort is the same as someone who lives with it. And I just don&#8217;t think that we can necessarily do that.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>I always think that trying to do the altruistic thing, like doing your research and figuring out what it is and trying to make decisions on behalf of other people as best you can, which is a terrible thing. Still, like decisions that take into account the experiences that people are sharing with you and then going to them and saying, &#8220;does this make that experience better or worse?&#8221; is the more sustainable option from my perspective, this is specifically leadership. Still, I think it&#8217;s true for accessibility as well, and probably product design as a whole, but it&#8217;s very difficult. Like people really feel like they understand the concept of empathy right now. And I do think that sometimes that leads us down the wrong path for things.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>What&#8217;s your thought on that? I think you kind of agree based on what your answer was&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>[Joe Devon 00:20:33]</strong> </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Oh, no, absolutely. And you know, we, you, can&#8217;t never about us without us, as the common saying, and we&#8217;ve gathered a group of a hundred people with a wide variety of disabilities for research. Whenever we do any UX and research, and sometimes we&#8217;re asked to just do research projects, we go out and ask the users.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>We had some really interesting companies approach us to do innovation and accessibility, and they had strong assumptions. We looked at the assumptions and agreed with it, but we&#8217;re like, all right, they were smart. They said, &#8220;vet this with users for us, please,&#8221; because they didn&#8217;t want to gather their own group.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>We vetted with users, and we&#8217;re blown away, always blown away because there are so many things you just don&#8217;t know unless you&#8217;ve lived with a particular disability. You can&#8217;t guess, and you&#8217;ve got to speak to your users and a wide variety of them. &nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>[Josepha Haden Chomphosy 00:21:30]</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>Yes, absolutely. Absolutely. What role does open source play in expanding accessibility, either in specifically the digital space or just accessibility in general?</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>[Joe Devon 00:21:42] </strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>I guess if the question is, what role does it play? I would say the role it plays is it is, unfortunately, it makes accessibility worse because, for the most part open source is not very accessible. And it&#8217;s a personal passion of mine, so I&#8217;m really glad that you brought that up. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>You know, it is so bizarre. You write a blog post and then it goes viral, and it goes viral every year to a degree that you can&#8217;t even believe it, that all these companies that you know are running events. Privately, publicly talking about it. And then you get all these people thanking you for what you&#8217;ve done year after year.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And then one year, you read on Twitter, The Blind Onion; I&#8217;m sure you&#8217;re familiar with The Onion, the satirical clip, there&#8217;s the Blind Onion. And they tweet out, &#8220;Now that Global Accessibility Awareness Day is over, we look forward to 364 days of global accessibility oblivion.&#8221; And that really hurt at the time, but at the same time, and I was told to ignore it, don&#8217;t worry about it, but I&#8217;m like, no, this is coming from a place of pain.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And the point of GAAD was to make a difference. It wasn&#8217;t too to just give everybody an opportunity to say, &#8220;Hey, look at what we&#8217;re doing,&#8221; and then not make a difference. So, as a result of that, I started to think about, well, where are we with this? And, and so I&#8217;ve created a state of accessibility report that through my company, we&#8217;re able to run for a few years, and it&#8217;s not, you know, the state is not great.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And I&#8217;m like, well, what can we do to change things? So, as a result of all of this, I really wanted to figure out, well, what can we do to make sure that GAAD does make a difference? And so, I came up with the idea of the GAAD pledge, which is specifically meant for open source frameworks. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>And the idea of the GAAD pledge is that an open source framework, when they are ready, takes the pledge to make accessibility a core value of the framework. Now, terms of what that actually entails are different for every single project because every project is unique. We did create a bit of a framework, which had the idea of saying, okay, you&#8217;re going to, first of all, create an accessibility statement that says that this framework is going to conform to whatever, WCAG, which is Web Content Accessibility Guidelines, to whatever WCAG level is decided and is appropriate for the framework. That there&#8217;s going to be documentation for anybody that is downloading this piece of open source project and trying to implement it, that there should be guidelines for them, that all of the examples should be accessible. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>It&#8217;s really important because even the frameworks that try to pay attention to accessibility. You&#8217;ll often see that people from the community will provide examples, and they&#8217;re inaccessible. And it&#8217;s really sad when you see that because so many people are just copy-pasting. That&#8217;s typically how it works, and they&#8217;re going to copy-paste something bad. So putting a statement around it, I think, would be really great.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And what we&#8217;re hoping to see is that lots and lots of big open source communities decide to take the pledge. And then it&#8217;ll sort of be table stakes that any new open source projects as well look, all of these frameworks that made it, they took the pledge and therefore we should take the pledge as well.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And so the very first year, we had React Native take the pledge, and they put a lot of effort into their accessibility. The second group to take it was Ember.js, and they always put a lot of effort into their accessibility, and they continued that effort. We&#8217;re about to announce the next one, but we&#8217;re still two weeks away.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>So I can&#8217;t say anything yet, but yeah, we&#8217;re, uh, we&#8217;re hoping for a lot more uptake on, on the gap pledge because it, it affects so many people downstream. WordPress&#8217;s what percent of the web right now? 43%? So there you go. That&#8217;s so many people.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>[Josepha Haden Chomphosy 00:25:57] </strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>So many people. Yeah, fun fact Gutenberg, our current rewriting of the editing experience in WordPress, primarily uses React. And so, I&#8217;m glad to hear that they have taken that pledge as well. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>As with any good cooking, it starts with good&nbsp;ingredients.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>[Joe Devon 00:26:12] </strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>You said it. That was great. I wish I was a cook, though.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>[Josepha Haden Chomphosy 00:26:23] </strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>I love it. All right. Let&#8217;s what keeps you up at night when it comes to the state of accessibility?&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>[Joe Devon 00:26:29] </strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>What keeps me up at night is how to move the needle. It is such a big thing to change. And there are so many angles that you can approach this with, but at the end of the day, it&#8217;s, it&#8217;s a monster.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>It&#8217;s a monster. There are so many legacy sites out there. If you look at WebAIM, they do a yearly report on the state of accessibility as well. They call it the WebAIM Million, and they&#8217;re typically seeing 97% inaccessible, 98%. It goes up and down a little bit every year. And that&#8217;s, that&#8217;s just a huge boat to move.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>I think we need to at least get the newer, uh, newer websites and mobile apps to move. And what we&#8217;ve seen in our state of accessibility report is that only the very top companies seem to put in the effort to make their products accessible. There is a big push with the enterprise companies to do it.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The CEOs are starting to talk about it, but what we need is the entire culture of software development to change. Or I should even say digital product development change and to move that boat is massive. And that&#8217;s I put it in my tagline in my email like that&#8217;s my mission in life, and I hope to achieve it before I die.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>So that keeps me up at night.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>[Josepha Haden Chomphosy 00:27:52] </strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>I think that would keep me up at night as well. I mean, it seems like you are really just personally mission-driven and impact-driven. Do you feel like, in the event that the work that you&#8217;ve accomplished so far is what you accomplish, you feel still like you&#8217;ve had an impact?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>I feel like you have had&nbsp;an impact. </p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>[Joe Devon 00:28:13] </strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>I&#8217;m not one of those people that tries to have a legacy or like tries to focus on what my impact is and all of that. I just try and do good work. And hopefully, it just shows at the end of the day. I&#8217;m just trying to have the impact without the accolades.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>[Josepha Haden Chomphosy 00:28:34]</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>I get it. Well, Joe, thank you so much for joining us here on this episode of WP Briefing. You have been a delight to chat with.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>[Joe Devon 00:28:42]</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>Likewise, it&#8217;s really been a pleasure to meet you, and uh, and I appreciate the opportunity.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>[Josepha Haden Chomphosy 00:28:54] </strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>And now it&#8217;s time for our smallest of big things. As I mentioned at the start, it is packed. Number one tomorrow, May 17th, RC3. So one of the final RCs that we&#8217;re going to have for the WordPress 6.0 release, unless something goes horribly, horribly wrong, which I don&#8217;t think it will. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>And then, two days after that, Global Accessibility Awareness Day, as I mentioned, will be on May 19th. So, this coming Thursday. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>And then next week, we have the 6.0 release. We have the WordPress 6.0 release on May 24th. </p>\n\n\n\n<p> Three days after that, WordPress turns 19 on May 27th, starting its final teenage year before we turn twenty in 2023. So that was the rapid-fire dance card for the next two weeks.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The stuff that is happening with and around WordPress for everyone to know. As a heads up, also, many people are headed to WordCamp Europe in Porto(, Portugal). The first week of June, I am going to do a live from WordCamp Europe episode. It will not be live. I&#8217;ll just record it live. And so. You know you&#8217;ll get to hear me with my hoarsest voice and maybe singing to my computer. Cause that almost always happens at these things. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>And that, my friends, is your small list of big things. Thank you for tuning in today for the WordPress Briefing. I&#8217;m your host, Josepha Haden Chomphosy. And I&#8217;ll see you again in a couple of weeks.</p>\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:7:\"pubDate\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:31:\"Mon, 16 May 2022 12:00:00 +0000\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}s:32:\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\";a:1:{s:7:\"creator\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:15:\"Chloe Bringmann\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}}}i:25;a:6:{s:4:\"data\";s:13:\"\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";s:5:\"child\";a:2:{s:0:\"\";a:5:{s:5:\"title\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:117:\"Gutenberg Times: Three Block Theme Generators, Gutenberg 13.2,  Coupons with Blocks and more –  Weekend Edition 215\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"guid\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:35:\"https://gutenbergtimes.com/?p=21139\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"link\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:120:\"https://gutenbergtimes.com/three-block-theme-generators-gutenberg-13-2-coupons-with-blocks-and-more-weekend-edition-215/\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:11:\"description\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:16135:\"<p>Howdy, </p>\n\n\n\n<p>I can hardly wait to be in the same room with fellow contributors across many teams during Contributor Day at WordCamp Europe, collaborate on the open-source project tasks, and meet new contributors in person!  </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Next week, my husband and I will fly to Porto for a two-week work-cation prior to WordCamp Europe.

She offers visitors to download a basic block theme, and empty theme and an advanced block theme. The latter is the best teaching tool, as it includes not only a bare bones theme, but also example templates, block patterns and block styles. With help of a bare bones form, you also can select your color palette and some default settings. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>While both mentioned Block Theme Generators are aimed at the Theme developers working with code, <strong><a href=\"https://twitter.com/pootlepress\">Jamie Marsland</a> of PootlePress</strong> just built a <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/redirect?event=video_description&redir_token=QUFFLUhqbHdSbUFVbnlGNUMtaUNwV010UnlORFN4WXJKQXxBQ3Jtc0trOUozOWRsMWZ2Ym91c25RcVB2bHJVZGlIWmFVaHhjR2lsMncxckIxQnppZlFsQnBmbkJ3aXd2QmtqN2tEbF8wLWJia192cjFSQzBydTBuUGhXTXBWcmFlSnlJbjlxbDVZVEt2OS11SEZ5eUREUS1iSQ&q=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.pootlepress.com%2Fwordpress-theme-builder%2F&v=mtINY03lycY\"><strong>Block Theme Generator</strong></a> that&#8217;s aimed at the #nocode site builder.

The event runs from May 16–20, 2022. While previous WordSesh events have always been high quality, this particular edition is jam-packed with a diverse selection of industry experts &#8211; many who have been building high impact projects with WordPress for years.</p>\n\n\n\n<img />A sampling of the speakers for WordSesh 2022\n\n\n\n<p>This year&#8217;s WordSesh will feature 20 sessions, 3 keynotes, and two in-depth workshops. On May 19, at 8PM EDT, frontend developer Ellen Bauer from Elma Studio will guide users in a workshop on how to &#8220;Convert a Classic Theme to a Block Theme.&#8221; If you are a theme developer who hasn&#8217;t taken the leap into block themes, this workshop will get you started:</p>\n\n\n\n<blockquote class=\"wp-block-quote\"><p>Together, we will set up the header and footer in a block theme, learn to work with Templates and Template Parts, set up page contents, and dive into how Styles work.</p><p>Throughout the workshop we&#8217;ll discuss which website projects can benefit from the new FSE features the most, what limitations we are still facing, and how the future of WordPress themes will most likely look.</p></blockquote>\n\n\n\n<p>The second workshop will be given by Tiffany Bridge, Product Manager at Nexcess, on May 20. She will give attendees an overview of how to prepare their web properties for a high traffic event.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>One of the most exciting sessions on the schedule is the keynote on May 19. The team that rebuilt <a href=\"https://www.whitehouse.gov/\">WhiteHouse.gov</a> on WordPress in just six months will join the event to talk about the project. Other topics on the schedule include custom block development, headless WordPress, hacking, client services, performance, accessibility, and user experience.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>In 2021, Brian Richards, founder of <a href=\"https://wpsessions.com/\">WPSessions.com</a> and organizer of WordSesh, has transitioned the event to be more inclusive of timezones around the world. This year&#8217;s event will happen over the course of four days, with time offsets that accommodate a global audience. The first block of sessions is optimally timed for attendees across Asia and the Pacific. Day 2 is designed for attendees across Europe, Middle East, and Africa, and day 3 will cater to attendees in the Americas, Iceland, and Greenland.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>&#8220;In 2019 and 2020 I ran entirely separate events for each region, but in 2021 I brought them back together as a single event,&#8221; Richards said. &#8220;I found it was a lot easier to get people excited about and paying attention to one big WordSesh event.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>&#8220;It feels more inclusive this way, even though the separate events were also open to attendees from around the world. I think that’s primarily because there is <em>something</em> that is conveniently scheduled for someone no matter where they live. And with a single event, watching the recordings feels more akin to catching up on the pieces you missed rather than trying to watch talks for an event that was designed for somebody else.&#8221;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The scheduling modifications seem to be working, as the last event in 2021 hosted 3,600 attendees, making WordSesh the second largest WordPress community event behind WCEU 2020. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Richards continues to curate a high-quality speaker lineup year after year, through the help of attendee surveys, which reveal where people are spending their time, attention, and money. WordSesh pays its speakers and Richards also invests time for personal outreach. Through this combination, he said the schedule fills up fast.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>&#8220;I think paying the speakers certainly helps with recruiting such incredible presenters, but I imagine that’s more icing on the cake for most speakers,&#8221; Richards said. &#8220;Probably the biggest draw is the history WordSesh now has (this is the 9th year and 12th event, officially), helped by the ever-increasing reach of my own personal network.&#8221;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Until 2021, Richards had been running the events entirely by himself. Last year he hired a part-time assistant and also started contracting out the video editing, which has helped him keep the event running more efficiently. It is quite a feat to have hosted WordSesh so many years running when many comparable virtual WordCamps of this caliber often rely on a large team of volunteers and organizers. </p>\n\n\n\n<p><a href=\"https://wordsesh.com/register/\">Registration for WordSesh</a> is still open and it&#8217;s <strong>free</strong> for anyone to attend. The event will be live captioned by real people and all sessions will be recorded for purchase later on WPSessions.</p>\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:7:\"pubDate\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:31:\"Fri, 13 May 2022 19:35:27 +0000\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}s:32:\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\";a:1:{s:7:\"creator\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:13:\"Sarah Gooding\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}}}i:27;a:6:{s:4:\"data\";s:13:\"\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";s:5:\"child\";a:2:{s:0:\"\";a:5:{s:5:\"title\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:68:\"Post Status: WordPress Podcast and Video Picks for the Week of May 8\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"guid\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:31:\"https://poststatus.com/?p=97445\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"link\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:79:\"https://poststatus.com/wordpress-podcast-and-video-picks-for-the-week-of-may-8/\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:11:\"description\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:2661:\"<div class=\"has-background has-theme-palette-7-background-color wp-block-post-excerpt\"><p class=\"wp-block-post-excerpt__excerpt\">Jane Genova on overcoming ageism.

How do we assess market share? What metrics matter? It\'s time we asked these questions. </p></div>\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-spacer\"></div>\n\n\n\n<p class=\"has-drop-cap\">This week brought some attention to WordPress\'s market share, at least as it gets reported by <strong>W3techs</strong>. For the first time, the WordPress market share <a href=\"https://w3techs.com/technologies/history_overview/content_management/all\">appears to have declined</a> — by 0.4% since February this year. David noticed this as soon as the first numbers were published and <a href=\"https://twitter.com/dimensionmedia/status/1518633952906461185\">tweeted about it on April 25th</a>. This week, <strong>Joost de Valk</strong> <a href=\"https://joost.blog/wordpress-market-share-shrinking/\">broke down the numbers</a> and gave his take on the causes of the decline.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>You should read the whole thing, but in Joost\'s opinion, the main cause of this multi-month trend is &#8220;out innovation&#8221; from <strong>Wix</strong> and <strong>Squarespace</strong>, even though both have had almost flat growth recently. Joost feels these centralized platforms can update customer sites with enhancements and best practices faster than WordPress can.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 id=\"h-is-pointing-fingers-at-full-site-editing-fair\">Is Pointing Fingers at Full Site Editing Fair?</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Unsurprisingly, Full Site Editing (as distinct from Gutenberg / the block editor) has come in for a lot of renewed criticism, with Joost leading the pack:</p>\n\n\n\n<blockquote class=\"wp-block-quote\"><p>&#8220;The Full Site Editing project is simply taking far too long. That’s causing the rest of the platform to lag behind current web trends.&#8221;</p></blockquote>\n\n\n\n<p><a href=\"https://twitter.com/jdevalk/status/1524354975089967105\">Others have suggested one or more primary causes</a>: the whole Gutenberg project, COVID, loss of in-person events, emphasis on PHP, emphasis on React/JavaScript, a decline in volunteering, and not enough core contributors. Sure, these are all possible influences in any downward trend. But it\'s an avalanche of anecdotes, speculation, axes to grind — and not a few potentially useful insights.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>A popular and reasonable opinion is that competing publishing platforms can handle some (typically simpler) use cases faster or easier than WordPress. If you don\'t care about the tool you use (or owning your own content, the GPL, open source, etc.) then WordPress isn\'t the first choice quite as clearly as it used to be for some use cases, like blogging or simple websites.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2>In Context, an Overreaction?</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>The global economic context right now is one of alarm over recession and &#8220;stagflation&#8221; indicators — flat or negative growth plus inflation. Many other CMS platforms are trending down or flattening in growth too. Under these conditions, a tiny 0.4% decline shouldn\'t ring any alarm bells.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>But as you can imagine (<a href=\"https://twitter.com/dimensionmedia/status/1524405251733921793\">and as David predicted</a>), many people are quick to offer dramatic opinions, but for others, it\'s an opportunity for the WordPress community to do some self-examination. </p>\n\n\n\n<h2>Is WordPress the iPod or the iPhone?</h2>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Joe Casabona</strong> compares WordPress to <a href=\"https://wpreview.io/wordpress-discontinued-ipod/\">the discontinued iPod</a> — an innovative breakthrough in its day that eventually became obsolete. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>We believe WordPress <a href=\"https://twitter.com/dimensionmedia/status/1435675442200162313\">might be closer to the iPhone</a>, however. Growth stops at some point for a dominant player that is still winning. The WordPress community should stop obsessing over growth and using it as our only measure of health and success. </p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Brian Coords</strong> takes a similar view and suggests <a href=\"https://masterwp.com/wordpress-needs-to-start-thinking-like-a-platform-again/\">WordPress should start thinking like a platform again</a>.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2>What do we know anyway?</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>That\'s not to say a reported 0.4% drop over 2-3 months is clearly a decline at all. Will it prove a lasting trend? </p>\n\n\n\n<p>As <strong>Alex Denning</strong> <a href=\"https://getellipsis.com/blog/wordpress-shrinking-maybe/\">observes</a>, year over year <strong>W3Techs</strong> shows the overall WordPress market share is <em>up</em> 1.7%. Moreover, W3techs has been our only measure of CMS market share. Their primary data comes from <strong>Alexa</strong> rankings, <a href=\"https://www.coywolf.news/seo/amazon-alexa-rank-end-of-life/\">a defunct service</a> as of this month. Alex lays his finger on our biggest challenge:</p>\n\n\n\n<blockquote class=\"wp-block-quote\"><p><em>&#8220;We had no idea why the market share was growing, and we accordingly have no idea why it’s shrinking.&#8221;</em></p></blockquote>\n\n\n\n<h2>We need to know!

I had spent nearly my entire adult life and most of my professional career within the WordPress space. However, the responsibilities of being a solo theme/plugin shop owner were like a boulder upon my shoulders that I could no longer hold up. After 11 years in the business, I was ready to throw in the towel.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>My work was my life, and my life was my work. I was not sure if I even knew how to do anything else. I briefly considered returning to South Korea for another year-long stint teaching English as a second language. But, I had already spent years rebuilding my life and relationships back in my home state of Alabama. <em>Plus, I was not prepared to say goodbye to my cats for that long.</em></p>\n\n\n\n<p>The only other practical experience I had was gardening and farming work. I have spent many summers working watermelon fields and hauling hay under the heat of the Alabama sun, and I have piddled around in my own garden over the years. However, I was not in a financially stable position to start my own farm. It was too risky a proposition at that stage in my life.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>I was also not quite ready to let go of WordPress. There was more that I wanted to accomplish, but I still faced the reality of needing to move on from the place I was at or find some way to get more joy out of the work I was doing.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>It was not until a few months later that the writing position for WP Tavern opened. I was hesitant about it at first. I figured I had the credentials and experience to do the job, but daily writing, editing, and publishing would be unlike anything I had taken on before. Sarah Gooding, who has been the best colleague anyone could ask for, convinced me that I should pursue this job.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>It turned out to be one of the best things to ever happen to me.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>As I got into the swing of things and began to find my voice, I was once again genuinely happy to be involved with the WordPress project. Since I have been here, I have rekindled the flame I once had with our beloved platform.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>I have made wonderful friends along the way. It has been a blessing to have the Tavern and its readers in my life.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Today, I am ready for a new challenge. I am stepping down from my role as a writer at WP Tavern.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>No, I am not ready to start that farm just yet. Y&#8217;all cannot get rid of me that easily. I will stick around the WordPress community for a while, but today is not about my new role. It is a celebration of the Tavern.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>I have published 647 stories and written 857 comments as of this post. I can only hope that, somewhere along the way, I have made an impact in some of your lives or work.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>As I leave, I have one request: be kind to one another.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>I believe we all want WordPress to be successful. We might have different opinions about how to make that happen. Sometimes, those ideas clash, but if we all treat one another with respect and have constructive discussions, things will work themselves out.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>To our readers, thank you for going on this journey with me.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>There are two remaining questions I want to answer before closing this chapter in my part of that journey. Feel free to continue reading. Otherwise, thank you for making it this far.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2>Writing About WordPress</h2>\n\n\n\n<img /><a href=\"https://wordpress.org/photos/photo/632620a981/\">Photo</a> by <a href=\"https://wordpress.org/photos/author/turtlepod/\">David Chandra Purnama</a>.\n\n\n\n<p>Someone messaged me a week or so into my employment at WP Tavern about writing for WordPress. They wanted to know how they could become a writer on WordPress-related topics and one day work in the field. At the time, I did not have a great answer to the question. Maybe I still do not, but I will take a crack at it.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>We might as well start with the advice of one of the most prolific writers in modern history, Stephen King. At the end of <em>The Stand</em>, one of my favorites from him, he answered this same question, and it has always resonated with me.</p>\n\n\n\n<blockquote class=\"wp-block-quote\"><p>When asked, &#8220;How do you write?&#8221; I invariably answer, &#8220;One word at a time,&#8221; and the answer is invariably dismissed. But that is all it is. It sounds too simple to be true, but consider the Great Wall of China, if you will: one stone at a time, man. That&#8217;s all. One stone at a time. But I&#8217;ve read you can see that mother&#8212; from space without a telescope.</p></blockquote>\n\n\n\n<p>I think he may be wrong about seeing the Great Wall from space (<em>Where&#8217;s a fact-checker when you need one?</em>), but it is still generally sound advice.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>I have been writing about WordPress for 17 years. Sometimes on my personal blog. At other times, I have taken one-off jobs. And, of course, I have written 100s of posts here at the Tavern. What has always helped me is sticking to topics I am passionate about. There are days when the job can be a grind (especially during slow news weeks), so you must love what you are doing to sustain any sort of career in writing.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>I have a B.A. in English with a secondary concentration in journalism. However, my education merely provided a solid foundation. It is not a prerequisite for doing the job.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>No one can teach you how to build those habits necessary for a sustainable career. They are too personal, and you can only figure out what works by practicing.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>No one can give you your voice. That is a discovery that only you can make, and writing is a discovery in and of itself.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>My advice to would-be writers is to give <a href=\"https://nanowrimo.org/\">National Novel Writing Month</a> a shot this November. It is a challenge to write 50,000 words in 30 days. I have won twice and hope to do it again this year. I guarantee that you will figure out everything you need to know about yourself as a writer if you push yourself through the challenge. It is OK to fail. Just dust yourself off and try again if you have your heart set on it.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>To the person who asked this question: I am sorry for not remembering your name. It has been over two years, and my memory is not what it once was. But, I hope you are reading now.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2>Spilling the Beans</h2>\n\n\n\n<img />Coffee Beans. <a href=\"https://wordpress.org/photos/photo/12961feeb9/\">Photo</a> by <a href=\"https://wordpress.org/photos/author/cagrimmett/\">Chuck Grimmett</a>\n\n\n\n<p>There is a question I get asked. <em>A lot.</em> Some of you probably already know what it is and have, perhaps, asked it or some variation of it yourself.</p>\n\n\n\n<blockquote class=\"wp-block-quote\"><p>Does Matt dictate or control the content that we cover?</p></blockquote>\n\n\n\n<p>Since it is my last day on the job, I might as well let readers peek behind the curtain. And the answer is no.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Sorry to let down our conspiracy-theory-loving readers, but the truth is just not that juicy.</em></p>\n\n\n\n<p>I always joke that I have only talked with &#8220;the boss&#8221; a handful of times while working here. That is pretty close to the truth (I have not actually kept count).</p>\n\n\n\n<p>From the day I arrived until today, I have had complete independence to thrive or fail by the result of my work. It felt like our small team had been left on an island to fend for ourselves at times. We must go through the same channels as other publications for information and have never been given special treatment.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>This level of autonomy is vital for journalistic integrity.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The WordPress community will always need a publication where its writers have the independence to do their work without conflicts of interest. The Tavern has always been that place, and I do not expect it to change going forward.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>I appreciate that our readers have trusted our team to perform this job. It is a responsibility that has not been taken lightly. I am proud to have contributed in at least in some small way.</p>\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:7:\"pubDate\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:31:\"Thu, 12 May 2022 22:47:12 +0000\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}s:32:\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\";a:1:{s:7:\"creator\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:14:\"Justin Tadlock\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}}}i:32;a:6:{s:4:\"data\";s:13:\"\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";s:5:\"child\";a:2:{s:0:\"\";a:5:{s:5:\"title\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:83:\"Do The Woo Community: Education, the LMS Ecosystem and WooCommerce with Ronnie Burt\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"guid\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:28:\"https://dothewoo.io/?p=71635\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"link\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:64:\"https://dothewoo.io/education-the-lms-ecosystem-and-woocommerce/\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:11:\"description\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:428:\"<p>Ronnie Burt from Sensei LMS shares insights and thoughts from his years of experience in education, WordPress, and WooCommerce</p>\n<p>&gt;&gt; The post <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://dothewoo.io/education-the-lms-ecosystem-and-woocommerce/\">Education, the LMS Ecosystem and WooCommerce with Ronnie Burt</a> appeared first on <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://dothewoo.io\">Do the Woo - a WooCommerce Builder Community</a>	.</p>\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:7:\"pubDate\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:31:\"Thu, 12 May 2022 14:00:01 +0000\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}s:32:\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\";a:1:{s:7:\"creator\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:5:\"BobWP\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}}}i:33;a:6:{s:4:\"data\";s:13:\"\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";s:5:\"child\";a:2:{s:0:\"\";a:5:{s:5:\"title\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:150:\"WPTavern: WordPress Community Attributes Declining Market Share to Performance Issues, Increased Complexity, and the Lagging Full-Site Editing Project\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"guid\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:30:\"https://wptavern.com/?p=134243\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"link\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:159:\"https://wptavern.com/wordpress-community-attributes-declining-market-share-to-performance-issues-increased-complexity-and-the-lagging-full-site-editing-project\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:11:\"description\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:11917:\"<p>For the first time in WordPress&#8217; nearly 19-year history, the software&#8217;s usage stats are showing signs of declining market share. Its remarkable ascension to 43.3% market share took a turn in March 2022 and usage has slowly declined since then, according to a new WordPress market share report from Joost de Valk that references <a href=\"https://w3techs.com/technologies/history_overview/content_management/all\">stats from W3Techs</a>. </p>\n\n\n\n<img />CMS usage stats since January 2011 &#8211; source: W3Techs\n\n\n\n<p>In a post titled &#8220;<a href=\"https://joost.blog/wordpress-market-share-shrinking/\">WordPress&#8217; Market Share Is Shrinking,</a>&#8221; de Valk highlighted the numbers from the last few months, which now conclusively demonstrate a decline:</p>\n\n\n\n<img />source: <a href=\"https://joost.blog/wordpress-market-share-shrinking/\">Joost de Valk</a>\n\n\n\n<p>de Valk&#8217;s analysis elaborates on how WordPress&#8217; market share, and that of its open source contemporaries, is being eroded by competitors like Wix and Squarespace. He attributes this change to two major factors: WordPress&#8217; lack of focus on performance, and the complexity of the unfinished full-site editing project:</p>\n\n\n\n<blockquote class=\"wp-block-quote\"><p>If you look at&nbsp;<a href=\"http://cwvtech.report/\">cwvtech.report</a>&nbsp;you’ll see that in the last year, sites on Wix and Squarespace on average have improved their site speed more than WordPress sites. WordPress has a performance team now, and it has made some progress. But the reality is that it hasn’t really made big strides yet, and in my opinion, really should. Project leadership still seems unwilling to focus on performance though, which has to do with the next point:</p><p>WordPress’ full site editing project is not done yet. Anecdotally, more and more people are having a hard time deciding how to build their site on WordPress. Wix and Squarespace are simply way simpler tools to build a site. As they improve their SEO tooling, there’s less and less reason to switch over to WordPress.</p></blockquote>\n\n\n\n<p>The post inspired rampant speculation in the community, and the discussion has splintered off into different pockets across the web &#8211; various <a href=\"https://twitter.com/jdevalk/status/1524354975089967105\">Twitter threads</a>, Post Status Slack, and a <a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/groups/advancedwp/posts/5335192453209592/\">post in the Advanced WP</a> group on Facebook that has already received more than 100 comments. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>It&#8217;s not realistic to expect any CMS to make gains every month, even if it has grown steadily in the past. WordPress is still far and away the market leader, but many see the new decline in market share as a symptom of a deeper problem.  No one can definitively say why WordPress is losing market share but the community has a few prevailing theories. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Performance is one of the contributing factors that is easier to measure than many others. According to <a href=\"https://t.co/UXrPUetsXH\">data from HTTP Archive</a>, WordPress trails its closest competitors when it comes to percentage of sites with good Core Web Vitals scores.</p>\n\n\n\n<img />\n\n\n\n<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m not excited to see the percentage drop, but it confirms even more that something needs to change,&#8221; Google-sponsored contributor Felix Arntz <a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/groups/advancedwp/posts/5335192453209592/?comment_id=5335463033182534&__cft__[0]=AZXHiAZGjTdaMvv69aWrE4uqcclxVqhyYOPyNLpAN6rFHg9aXVJM5D_cSXcFPU5STYxj6mrkzp7e909jEvJgUKrPSAoI1AlPn2app0822R8UjgvsZpLbxfepE6ci8tTiWC62JubpIYAVNcgp3lYcNVzZ&__tn__=R]-R\">said</a>. &#8220;It&#8217;s also worth adding that the growth rate of other CMSs like Wix or Shopify has already long surpassed WordPress even before this. My session at WordCamp Europe is precisely going to focus on this topic.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>&#8220;All this is why we started the WordPress performance team a couple months back, we need to make more solid performance decisions out of the box for WordPress. Let&#8217;s work together so that we can turn this around over the next few years.&#8221;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Many saw the news of WordPress&#8217; declining market share as an opportunity to weigh in on their pet grievances about WordPress and the Gutenberg project in general, but there are some legitimate concerns about the condition of the software when it&#8217;s rolled out to millions of users.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>&#8220;Full site editing and its deployment into core before it has really been ready isn’t doing us any favors for newcomers to WordPress,&#8221; WordPress developer Daniel Schutzsmith <a href=\"https://twitter.com/schutzsmith/status/1524420452021682181\">said</a>. &#8220;It throws them off and scares them because it feels broken in many aspects.&#8221;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>WordPress&#8217; increasing complexity is another strong factor many participants cited as a possible influence, particularly those who build websites for clients. The software has become more sophisticated, enabling users to do more things than ever before, but it&#8217;s not getting easier to use.  </p>\n\n\n\n<p>&#8220;I don’t do much WP dev anymore, but after needing multiple articles and a YouTube tutorial for me to understand the new Navigation block, I knew WP was in serious trouble,&#8221; developer Alexis Rae <a href=\"https://twitter.com/TransCinderella/status/1524363595903025152?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw%7Ctwcamp%5Etweetembed%7Ctwterm%5E1524363595903025152%7Ctwgr%5E%7Ctwcon%5Es1_&ref_url=https%3A%2F%2Fwptavern.com%2Fwp-admin%2Fpost.php%3Fpost%3D134243action%3Dedit\">said</a>. &#8220;That 5.9 pushed out full site editing as the only option (that I can tell) while it’s a beta is insane.&#8221;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Multiple participants in the discussions on Facebook and Twitter said they have recently been building some of their clients&#8217; sites with other technologies to make it easier for their clients to manage their websites.</p>\n\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-embed__wrapper\">\n<blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\"><p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\">&#8230; for the last few years, this hasn\'t been our experience and eyes are wondering towards other solutions. We\'ve already delivered sites on Webflow, and even a couple on Squarespace. That would have been unthinkable two years ago.</p>&mdash; Nick Wilmot (@nickwilmot) <a href=\"https://twitter.com/nickwilmot/status/1524416730805776384?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">May 11, 2022</a></blockquote>\n</div>\n\n\n\n<p>&#8220;From working with clients I notice that the quality of the admin interface is really becoming an issue that turns people off from WordPress,&#8221; Florian Fermin <a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/groups/168889943173228/user/1498532059/?__cft__[0]=AZXHiAZGjTdaMvv69aWrE4uqcclxVqhyYOPyNLpAN6rFHg9aXVJM5D_cSXcFPU5STYxj6mrkzp7e909jEvJgUKrPSAoI1AlPn2app0822R8UjgvsZpLbxfepE6ci8tTiWC62JubpIYAVNcgp3lYcNVzZ&__tn__=R]-R\">said</a>. &#8220;On the lower end, this drives people to go to Squarespace and Wix instead. On the high end, I have now migrated multiple sites away from WordPress to CraftCMS and clients have been delighted with the clean interface it provides, and they&#8217;re confident to make small changes themselves, allowing me to put my energy in more exciting stuff.&#8221;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>WordPress gained popularity early on by being the best free software available for blogging, and then later for its flexibility as a CMS. The transition into a nocode style site builder has been difficult with extensive periods of growing pains. As most of the energy and resources put into core seem to go towards Gutenberg, other older aspects of the software have gone neglected. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>&#8220;WordPress has really developed into jack of all trades and master of none,&#8221; Fermin said. &#8220;In my experience, this has meant in the last years that when I have to recommend a CMS for the use case of a client, more and more often the answer has been something else and not WordPress.&#8221;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>WordPress used to be one of the strongest solutions on the market for building small, simple sites but competitors are making it faster and easier to launch these kinds of sites. Meanwhile, WordPress themes are going through a rocky transition towards better accommodating full-site editing features. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>&#8220;For my clients (mostly government), FSE is not the way to go,&#8221; WordPress developer Roy Tanck <a href=\"https://twitter.com/roytanck/status/1524394782176514049?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw%7Ctwcamp%5Etweetembed%7Ctwterm%5E1524394782176514049%7Ctwgr%5E%7Ctwcon%5Es1_&ref_url=https%3A%2F%2Fwptavern.com%2Fwp-admin%2Fpost.php%3Fpost%3D134243action%3Dedit\">said</a>. &#8220;I spend a lot of my time disabling new features now. If WP continues to become a &#8216;site builder,&#8217; traditional CMS clients will likely start to look elsewhere.&#8221;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>In his conclusion, Joost de Valk contends that the full-site editing project is taking far too long. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>&#8220;That’s causing the rest of the platform to lag behind current web trends,&#8221; he said. &#8220;Without a drastic change in this approach I think WordPress will continue to lose market share for the next few years.&#8221;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Although some may agree that the project is taking a long time to reach a polished state, much of the feedback on social media indicates that developers do not find FSE user friendly enough for their clients. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>&#8220;WordPress is just too complicated for the majority to use effectively,&#8221; development agency owner Jon Brown <a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/groups/advancedwp/posts/5335192453209592/?comment_id=5335256633203174&__cft__[0]=AZXHiAZGjTdaMvv69aWrE4uqcclxVqhyYOPyNLpAN6rFHg9aXVJM5D_cSXcFPU5STYxj6mrkzp7e909jEvJgUKrPSAoI1AlPn2app0822R8UjgvsZpLbxfepE6ci8tTiWC62JubpIYAVNcgp3lYcNVzZ&__tn__=R]-R\">said</a>.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>&#8220;WordPress ought to be way more opinionated on accessibility and performance such that users should not even have to think about them. The problem with the current WP philosophy it is &#8216;let’s do as little as possible to leave options for the user or make the user rely on plugins&#8217;… No! Stop that. Do more by default and then give the user the option to override that if/when necessary.&#8221;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Brown said this applies to core WordPress but is most evident in WooCommerce, where, after ten years, &#8220;you still need 25 add-ons just to get a basic store up and running.&#8221;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>&#8220;This is why Shopify is devouring e-commerce market share,&#8221; he said.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>&#8220;And simple personal sites, way easier to setup a five-page site on Squarespace or Wix for laypeople than it is to navigate WordPress.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>&#8220;How to regain market share? Simplify.&#8221;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Is WordPress losing touch with every day users? After two years of drastically reduced WordCamps and meetups, this is a genuine possibility. Many months before WordPress&#8217; market share growth started leveling off, the strangely feverish push to return to in-person events during a pandemic seemed to betray an insecurity about what might happen to the community if required to continue on in isolation. WordPress usage numbers could be impacted by missing out on some of the grassroots growth and momentum that in-person events often generate. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>WordPress&#8217; relationship with the common user seems strained at the moment. It is no longer considered one of the easiest ways to get a website off the ground. Those who are eager to see WordPress succeed and grow can likely agree at almost any point in time that WordPress is not yet easy enough to use. A veritable army of Gutenberg contributors are working day and night to make full-site editing possible, but the project cannot afford to shelve usability concerns for too much longer, or it risks becoming software that is only used by an elite, knowledgeable few.</p>\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:7:\"pubDate\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:31:\"Thu, 12 May 2022 04:57:30 +0000\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}s:32:\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\";a:1:{s:7:\"creator\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:13:\"Sarah Gooding\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}}}i:34;a:6:{s:4:\"data\";s:13:\"\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";s:5:\"child\";a:2:{s:0:\"\";a:5:{s:5:\"title\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:106:\"WPTavern: Gutenberg 13.2 Adds Persistent User Preferences and a Visualizer for Margin and Padding Controls\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"guid\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:30:\"https://wptavern.com/?p=134247\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"link\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:117:\"https://wptavern.com/gutenberg-13-2-adds-persistent-user-preferences-and-a-visualizer-for-margin-and-padding-controls\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:11:\"description\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:4891:\"<p>Gutenberg 13.2 was released earlier today. While much of the developer community is gearing up for the WordPress 6.0 release in two weeks, work continues steadily on the plugin, driving future updates. The latest release is not as hefty on enhancements as previous updates but includes around four dozen bug fixes.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Despite a heavy focus on squashing bugs, there are several welcome improvements in the plugin update. Persistent user preferences will make for fewer surprises when opening the editor. New visual updates for block spacing and the Post Comments Form block make it easier to design layouts.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Developers should look at the early work on a <a href=\"https://github.com/WordPress/gutenberg/pull/40547\">new <code>settings</code> hook</a>. This represents one step toward creating the <a href=\"https://github.com/WordPress/gutenberg/issues/40318\">concept of &#8220;sections&#8221;</a> that can house settings and styles for block instances and descendants. Patterns are a prime example of the necessity of sections. Matias Ventura <a href=\"https://github.com/WordPress/gutenberg/issues/39281\">covered the various uses</a> in a separate open ticket.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The latest release also <a href=\"https://github.com/WordPress/gutenberg/pull/40652\">removes spotlight mode</a> for template parts, and I say, <em>good riddance</em>. The editor already has such a mode for all blocks, and users who prefer it can enable it.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2>Persistent Editor Preferences</h2>\n\n\n\n<img />Welcome to the editor popup.\n\n\n\n<p>Have you ever visited the WordPress editor and noticed the &#8220;welcome&#8221; popup, despite dismissing it ages ago? Or, logged in with a new browser only to reconfigure settings, such as enabling top toolbar support and turning off fullscreen mode? <em>Annoying, right?</em></p>\n\n\n\n<p>This has been a <a href=\"https://github.com/WordPress/gutenberg/issues/15105\">long-standing issue</a> caused by WordPress storing user preferences in the browser. In Gutenberg 13.2, these preferences are now <a href=\"https://github.com/WordPress/gutenberg/pull/39795\">saved as user metadata</a> in the database and should no longer pose an issue.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Sarah Gooding took a deeper dive into this problem and solution in an <a href=\"https://wptavern.com/coming-in-gutenberg-13-1-users-editor-preferences-will-be-stored-in-the-database-improving-persistence-across-sessions\">earlier post on the Tavern</a>.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2>Padding and Margin Visualizers</h2>\n\n\n\n<img />Adding margin to the Group block.\n\n\n\n<p>Landing in the pretty-neat-and-nice-to-have category is a <a href=\"https://github.com/WordPress/gutenberg/pull/40505\">new &#8220;visualizer&#8221; feature</a> for block margin and padding. Essentially, it displays a colored box, representing the space when one of the two options is adjusted. It quickly fades out and returns the canvas to its default look.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>I am a fan of this change. It draws the eyes back to the canvas and allows users to visualize how the block spacing is applied.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2>Comments Form in the Editor</h2>\n\n\n\n<img />Comments Form Block in the site editor.\n\n\n\n<p>The Post Comments Form block was simply a placeholder in the editor in past releases. This did not allow end-users to see how it would look on the front end of their sites.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Gutenberg 13.2 updates this to show something <a href=\"https://github.com/WordPress/gutenberg/pull/40368\">closer to what it will look like </a>on the front end, at least for logged-in users. This also lets the user see how color and typography customizations will be displayed.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>This is a two-part change. The Comments Query Loop block now <a href=\"https://github.com/WordPress/gutenberg/pull/40256\">outputs the form within its default template</a>. This way, users and creators will not need to build out each part of the overall comments area.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>There is still much work to do for the Post Comments Form block in the long term. It needs a broader selection of design tools for starters. However, it could also use a revamp that provides fine-grain control over the various elements shown for logged-in and logged-out users. That may even mean splitting the form into multiple blocks. For now, the additional visualization will have to suffice.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2>Margin Support for Separators</h2>\n\n\n\n<img />Adding top and bottom margin to a Separator block.\n\n\n\n<p>The Separator block now <a href=\"https://github.com/WordPress/gutenberg/pull/40551\">supports top and bottom margins</a>. Users can adjust it from the spacing tools in the sidebar.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>It is a small change but a welcome one. Users could previously increase the space between a Separator and sibling block through other means, such as setting the margin on the sibling or using a Spacer. However, those were often unintuitive solutions. And decreasing the space sometimes seemed an impossible task.</p>\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:7:\"pubDate\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:31:\"Thu, 12 May 2022 04:30:12 +0000\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}s:32:\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\";a:1:{s:7:\"creator\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:14:\"Justin Tadlock\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}}}i:35;a:6:{s:4:\"data\";s:13:\"\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";s:5:\"child\";a:2:{s:0:\"\";a:5:{s:5:\"title\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:62:\"Post Status: Getting to ‘Yes’ on Plugin “License Hell”\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"guid\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:31:\"https://poststatus.com/?p=97406\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"link\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:61:\"https://poststatus.com/getting-to-yes-on-plugin-license-hell/\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:11:\"description\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:7620:\"<div class=\"has-background has-theme-palette-8-background-color wp-block-post-excerpt\"><p class=\"wp-block-post-excerpt__excerpt\">Is there a win-win solution for plugin owners fighting churn and their professional WordPress customers, like agencies and freelancers? </p></div>\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-spacer\"></div>\n\n\n\n<p class=\"has-drop-cap\">I appreciate&nbsp;<a href=\"https://poststatus.com/wordpress-plugin-license-renewals-and-the-challenge-of-churn/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">Rob Howard\'s response</a>&nbsp;to&nbsp;<a href=\"https://twitter.com/post_status/status/1518994407864684545\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">the insightful discussion</a>&nbsp;that emerged on Twitter over MemberPress\'s new subscription renewal interface in the WordPress dashboard. I learned a lot, and I was reminded this controversy goes back a long way. In 2015 we wrote about unhappy customer reactions when&nbsp;<a href=\"https://poststatus.com/notes/jetbrains-refines-new-phpstorm-subscriptions/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">JetBrains adopted an Adobe CS payment model for PHPstorm</a>.

Is completely locking out users when there\'s not a valid support key out of step with a community ethic, i.e. &#8220;The WordPress Way?&#8221; That\'s a big and important topic, but there\'s some low-hanging fruit in the far less contentious problems Rob helpfully focused on. Maybe there is a potential win-win solution. His ideas might satisfy the two most legitimately frustrated (but seemingly opposed) perspectives in this controversy:</p>\n\n\n\n<ol><li>Plugin owners fighting subscriber churn so they can sustain their businesses.</li><li>Their customers and colleagues in the WordPress ecosystem, especially WordPress agencies and freelancers. They\'re also trying to run their businesses and don\'t want the extra work and potential embarrassments license management can create.</li></ol>\n\n\n\n<p>As Rob points out, aggressive upsells and lockouts are aimed at the mass market of common WordPress users. They\'re for people who don\'t understand what they\'ve installed or why they might pay for it. The target is not highly WordPress-literate people — especially those who are building sites professionally.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Unfortunately, we all get the same annoyances in our WordPress dashboards anyhow.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 id=\"h-small-agencies-and-site-builders-are-your-friends\">Small agencies and site builders are your friends</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Site builders, small web dev teams, and WordPress agencies don\'t want their clients confused or hassled with upsells.

Even if they hand off this responsibility to the site owner or cover it with ongoing maintenance and support services — something&nbsp;<a href=\"https://poststatus.com/notes/you-might-not-want-to-use-your-developer-licenses-for-your-clients-plugins/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">Syed Balkhi recommended in 2015</a>&nbsp;— managing license keys&nbsp;<a href=\"https://poststatus.com/notes/crate-wants-help-escape-license-key-hell/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">will still be hell</a> for someone.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>I haven\'t thought about <a href=\"https://cratewp.com/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">Crate</a> in a long time, but it has been around for quite some time. It\'s a way to get out of &#8220;license hell&#8221; — and deal with other challenges that won\'t apply and can\'t be afforded by a lot of small to mid-sized WordPress businesses. Rob\'s <a href=\"https://wordpress.org/plugins/wp-wallet/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">WP Wallet</a> is aimed at that broader market. It sounds like a worthwhile project, along with <a href=\"https://poststatus.com/podcast/wp-notify/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">WP Notify</a> and <a href=\"https://poststatus.com/podcast/clarity/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">Clarity</a>. For those who work with WordPress on a daily basis, getting control of notifications and aggressive advertising in the WordPress back-end is universally wanted.</p>\n\n\n\n<blockquote><p> It would be fantastic if more plugin shops catered to the needs and concerns of agencies and freelancers who don\'t want their clients to ever see an upgrade notice or an upsell pretending to be one.</p></blockquote>\n\n\n\n<h2 id=\"h-is-license-hell-necessary\">Is license hell necessary?</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>It\'s not hard to see that people who want to pay for plugins (and essentially resell them to their customers) are the people you want to keep happy and maintain a good relationship with, as a plugin owner. It would be fantastic if more plugin shops catered to the needs and concerns of agencies and freelancers who don\'t want their clients to ever see an upgrade notice or an upsell pretending to be one. (Or to be locked out of anything.)</p>\n\n\n\n<blockquote><p>Educating newcomers to WordPress and shaping their expectations about your product is good for everyone.</p></blockquote>\n\n\n\n<h2 id=\"h-whiny-free-riders-are-people-and-potential-customers-too\">Whiny free-riders are people (and potential customers) too</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>I\'d also like to stick up for the frustrations of people who just don\'t understand what a support license subscription is and why they should happily pay for continuous upgrades. Yes, they often look like and act like free riders. We can\'t expect different if we don\'t market and communicate effectively to them.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Educating newcomers to WordPress and shaping their expectations about your product is good for everyone. If customers or potential customers are upset because they\'re being pressed to repeatedly pay for something they don\'t understand (it’s not a buy-once, own-forever product!) that\'s on the seller. Rob has some good ideas for how to better communicate the proper expectations to customers. Giving options to people who want to pay one time or less frequently than an annual cycle is one solution that ought to appeal to professional WordPressers too.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 id=\"h-product-or-service-what-am-i-paying-for-what-do-i-own\">Product or service? What am I paying for? What do I own?</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>A decade ago (and even before that) I used to keep local copies of WordPress plugins (and add-ons for other CMSes) even though I knew it was pointless because they\'d be obsolete quickly. I was treating plugins like my music collection in the early days of iTunes. I knew it was crazy, but the drive to &#8220;own&#8221; something is strong. Many of us are now paying to access music we previously owned on CDs, tapes, etc.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>This is still a new and evolving digital media culture. There are good reasons many people resist the SaaSification of everything. It\'s a model that makes sense for a lot of commercial plugins: mimic Netflix\'s marketing and sell a plugin as a service . But <a href=\"https://speckyboy.com/wordpress-theme-plugin-license-expires/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">I agree with Eric Karkovack</a> that more needs to be done to help potential customers understand the value of continuously paying for software updates.

That’s what Courtney is involved in and what this podcast is all about.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>We talk about the history of the project and how it was started as a way to assist people in putting on WordCamps and Meetups. Since then the scope of WordPress training has grown enormously.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>We discuss what areas of WordPress are covered by the learning materials, what constraints there are on the type of content that is made, and what formats they take.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Who creates the content and how do they ensure that it’s up to date and of a high enough standard? Can people become certified if they complete different learning paths?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>We round off by talking about how you can become involved with the team if you’re keen to help others learn more about WordPress.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2>Useful links.</h2>\n\n\n\n<p><a href=\"https://courtneyr.dev/\">Courtney&#8217;s website</a></p>\n\n\n\n<p><a href=\"https://learn.wordpress.org/\">Learn WordPress</a></p>\n\n\n\n<p><a href=\"https://make.wordpress.org/training/\">WordPress Training Team</a></p>\n\n\n\n<p><a href=\"https://make.wordpress.org/training/getting-started/\">What does the WordPress Training team do?</a></p>\n\n\n\n<p><a href=\"https://make.wordpress.org/training/handbook/guidelines/brand-usage-guidelines/\">Brand Usage Guidelines</a></p>\n\n\n\n<p><a href=\"https://make.wordpress.org/training/handbook/guidelines/promotional-guidelines/\">Promotional Guidelines</a></p>\n\n\n\n<p><a href=\"https://make.wordpress.org/training/2022/01/18/training-team-goals-for-2022/\">Training Team Goals for 2022</a></p>\n\n\n\n<p><a href=\"https://make.wordpress.org/training/2022/05/03/may-2022-sprint/\">May 2022 Sprint</a></p>\n\n\n\n<p><a href=\"https://github.com/WordPress/Learn/projects/2?card_filter_query=label%3A%22%5Bpriority%5D+high%22#column-17929295\">Learn WordPress Github repo</a></p>\n\n\n\n<p><a href=\"https://github.com/WordPress/Learn/issues/new?assignees=&labels=Awaiting+Triage%2C+%5BContent+Type%5D+Lesson+Plan&template=lesson-plan-template.md&title=Topic+-+Lesson+Plan\">Lesson Plan template</a></p>\n\n\n\n<p><a href=\"https://learn.wordpress.org/lesson-plans\">Lesson Plans</a></p>\n\n\n\n<p><a href=\"https://learn.wordpress.org/workshops/\">Workshops</a></p>\n\n\n\n<p><a href=\"https://learn.wordpress.org/courses/\">Courses</a></p>\n\n\n\n<p><a href=\"https://learn.wordpress.org/social-learning/\">Social Learning Spaces </a></p>\n\n\n\n<p><a href=\"https://learn.wordpress.org/pathways-to-learn-wordpress/\">Pathways to Learn WordPress</a></p>\n\n\n\n<p><a href=\"https://make.wordpress.org/training/2021/05/03/high-level-roadmap-to-learning-wordpress-development/\">High-Level Roadmap to Learning WordPress Development</a></p>\n\n\n\n<p><a href=\"https://make.wordpress.org/training/2021/08/08/who-can-learn-help/\">Who can Learn WordPress help?</a></p>\n\n\n\n<p><a href=\"https://make.wordpress.org/meetings/#training\">Upcoming WordPress Meetings</a></p>\n\n\n\n<p><a href=\"https://make.wordpress.org/training/2021/09/27/proposal-ensuring-high-quality-video-contributions-to-learn-wordpress/\">Ensuring high-quality video contributions to Learn WordPress</a></p>\n\n\n\nTranscript<div>\n<p>[00:00:00] <strong>Nathan Wrigley:</strong> Welcome to the Jukebox podcast from WP Tavern. My name is Nathan Wrigley. Jukebox is a podcast which is dedicated to all things WordPress, the people, the events, the plugins, the themes, the blocks, and in this case, learning about how WordPress works. If you&#8217;d like to subscribe to the podcast, you can do that by searching for WP Tavern in your podcast player of choice, or by going to wptavern.com forward slash feed forward slash podcast.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And you can copy that URL into most podcasts players. If you have a topic that you&#8217;d like us to feature on the podcast, I&#8217;m keen to hear from you and hopefully get you or your idea featured on the show. Head over to wptavern.com forward slash contact forward slash jukebox and use the contact form there.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>So on the podcast today we have Courtney Robertson. Courtney is a developer advocate at GoDaddy Pro who has a passion for teaching and learning, specifically about how to use WordPress. Her work for GoDaddy Pro involves outreach to developers, but it also includes time to help contribute to WordPress as well. Courtney uses this time to assist with the WordPress training team, as well as Learn WordPress.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>If you&#8217;re new to WordPress or have been using it for years, there&#8217;s always something new to learn. WordPress never stands still. In the recent past, the adoption of blocks and full site editing has meant that the way of interacting with WordPress has changed entirely.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>You could of course, figure out how everything in WordPress works all by yourself, but it would be great if there were freely available materials, which you could use to accelerate your knowledge. That&#8217;s what Courtney is involved in and what this podcast is all about.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>We talk about the history of the project and how it was started as a way to assist people in putting on WordCamps and meetups. Since then, the scope of WordPress training has grown enormously.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>We discuss what areas of WordPress are covered by the learning materials, what constraints there are on the types of content that is made, and what formats they take. Who creates the content and how do they ensure that it&#8217;s up to date and have a high enough standard? Can people become certified if they complete different learning paths? We round off by talking about how you can become involved with the team if you&#8217;re keen to help others learn more about WordPress.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>If you&#8217;re interested in finding out more, you can find all the links in the show notes by heading over to wptavern.com forward slash podcast, where you&#8217;ll find all the other episodes as well.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And so, without further delay. I bring you Courtney Robertson.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>I am joined on the podcast today by Courtney Robertson. Hello Courtney.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:03:29] <strong>Courtney Robertson:</strong> Hello Nathan, how are you today?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:03:31] <strong>Nathan Wrigley:</strong> I&#8217;m really good. Thanks for joining us on the podcast today?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>We are going to talk about learning all about WordPress, how you might learn about the things that are going on in WordPress and potentially how you may contribute to that learning process for other people.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>But before we get into that, Courtney, I always ask a fairly generic question at the start. I want some orientation really, so that people who are listening know who you are. Would you mind just telling us a little bit about yourself and your relationship with WordPress.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:03:59] <strong>Courtney Robertson:</strong> Sure. So I first found WordPress because I was teaching in a classroom in 2006. Needed both an LMS and a blog. And at that time, LMS was not an option inside of WordPress yet. WordPress was really just getting started. So I remember, I think around WordPress version two, installing it and figuring out what was going on.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>I have spent some time building sites for clients. And then I found myself back to teaching again with high school students. Teaching WordPress development this time. And it would have been around 2015 in a career technical school. Later I went on to work at a few plug-in companies. I got a lot of experience in The Events Calendar. Writing technical documents, knowledge-base articles, making sure front of sight was updated along with all of our releases.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And then later found myself teaching WordPress development at a front end dev bootcamp. So I had both high school students and adults that were laid off due to Covid, going through a program free of charge to them. And in fact, our high school students were paid to do this. My students got to speak for WordCamp Philly, so that was really exciting.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And then I found that I really wanted to go a level up, and make the training material that any institution could use. I found the material needed to teach WordPress development successfully, to get folks actually employed in the WordPress industry. And so an opportunity opened up at GoDaddy Pro for me as a developer advocate, and that affords me some time to continue contributing to the training team.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:05:37] <strong>Nathan Wrigley:</strong> Would you be able to just elucidate a little bit more about the GoDaddy Pro angle? How does that work? Are you essentially employed by GoDaddy Pro and they allow you to have a proportion of your time over at the learn project that we&#8217;re going to be talking about later?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:05:52] <strong>Courtney Robertson:</strong> Yes, that would be correct. So I am a developer advocate, which means that my internal work involves our outreach and our community efforts, specifically oriented for developers. But also this role is one that involves contributing to WordPress itself. And the avenue that I take with that is to contribute on learn.wordpress.org or the WordPress training team.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>So in companies that have folks contributing to the project. Some are full-time sponsored. Some get a certain number of hours per week, or per month, or however the company chooses to allocate that to contribute towards WordPress.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:06:32] <strong>Nathan Wrigley:</strong> Now I&#8217;m guessing, and we&#8217;ll come to that a little bit later. I&#8217;m guessing that there&#8217;ll be an opportunity in this podcast to talk about how other people may become involved. Before we get to that, let&#8217;s just deal with what the whole learn project is. And again, it&#8217;s a fairly generic question.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Would you just give us some, some understanding of what we might find, what the history of learn is over the last few years? Basically, what is the learn project all about?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:06:57] <strong>Courtney Robertson:</strong> Yeah. So the team behind the learn project is the training team. And we&#8217;ve been around since 2013, and have been working on creating content that would be published eventually on learn. learn.Wordpress.org launched in 2020, during the height of Covid. So we already had a stockpile of content ready to go, and we&#8217;re able to load that up.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Learn has several different purposes or formats. Different audiences can come to learn. So the training team began with a mission of creating material for meetup organizers. If you&#8217;re hosting a meetup and you&#8217;re doing the work of preparing the meetup, but then you also need to figure out what&#8217;s my topic and who&#8217;s presenting and all of these things.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Well, the training team has been making lesson plans available, so that a meetup organizer already has topics at the ready. With research done, and all of the resources available. Indicating, cover this topic, here&#8217;s how to present the information. But also those same lesson plans have been used in a few different week long type of workshops.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>So we have quite a good bit of material in that regard. We also have workshops. Workshops are videos. They&#8217;re on demand, and their audience is direct learners. So somebody that wants to find out how to do the thing, at any time of day can come and watch the video. The videos could also be played, I have heard that several meetup groups have done this during a meetup or string, a series of them together.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And then we have courses. And courses are sort of a roll-up of both of those pieces. So if you think of your years in school. You had a specific subject that you were studying. That was an entire course. And each day your instructor or presenter would have a smaller segment for just that day to cover.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>So a course would bring in some of the content from lesson plans and some of the content from workshops. And it would be self-paced, on demand. And those courses, when you complete them, do show a completion notification, I would say, on your wordpress.org profile. So if you&#8217;re looking at your wordpress.org profile and you look at the activity, you would see if somebody has completed a course.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>We have a proposal out to move those to its own designated tab. Going to give the heads up ahead of time, we&#8217;ll never call them batches because teams use badges to indicate contributors to teams in WordPress. But learn.wordpress.org is a great resource for somebody that wants to come and learn all kinds of things.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Whether you are teaching others, or on demand learning, and you just need that one specific piece or want to go through an entire course. And at this time, I believe we&#8217;ve got five courses on getting started with WordPress, all the way up through using FSE, full site editing, to build out a site. And we have a few contributor courses that have moved over that the community team had housed previously, to help folks get onboarded with contributing.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And then finally we have social learning spaces. And you may see those in your WordPress dashboard on the upcoming events area, but you also can find them on learn.wordpress.org. It is technically a meetup group under the hood and uses Zoom. These are sessions that happen and there are several throughout the week. Every week, there are several going on that you could swing by for about an hour. Sometimes an hour and a half or so, and learn whatever the topic is that&#8217;s being presented that day. Great folks like Daisy Olsen have been running a lot of those along with Sarah Snow. I&#8217;ve got one coming up soon with Anne and Sarah. Anne, a lot of us know, Anne McCarthy. We&#8217;ll be doing a call for testing using one of those social learning spaces.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:10:31] <strong>Nathan Wrigley:</strong> That&#8217;s fabulous. I genuinely didn&#8217;t know that prime mover of the whole learn project was to assist people putting on meetups. Was the intention there just to facilitate people who were potentially, maybe trying it out for the first time. We were all in lockdown, as you said, and, and it&#8217;s quite daunting, isn&#8217;t it to</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:10:49] <strong>Courtney Robertson:</strong> Yeah.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:10:49] <strong>Nathan Wrigley:</strong> to begin something like that, and just the process of setting one up might be daunting enough, but then to actually find material that you can talk about, was that the intention there? Just to bootstrap and kickstart more and more meetups?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:11:00] <strong>Courtney Robertson:</strong> That was the intention in 2013. It has grown significantly, as you can imagine in that time. As has WordPress and the WordPress community. So in 2013, meetups were really just a new thing. And we were looking at ways to support meetup groups. And as things have evolved, we now want to help the job pipelines. We would like to provide some official guidance as to what should be covered for what skillsets.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:11:29] <strong>Nathan Wrigley:</strong> It&#8217;s a really exciting time in WordPress. There&#8217;s so much happening. A lot of that centered around the new editor and full site editing and so on. So there&#8217;s definitely lots and lots of opportunities for things to be taught. I&#8217;m just wondering, in terms of the types of content that you will be putting or potentially that you will have put. Do you have any sort of constraints on the remit of the project?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>So for example, is it always going to be focused on the core of WordPress? Things that you can do inside of Core? What I&#8217;m really asking there, I suppose, in a backhanded way is do you stray into other areas, for example, things like third party plugins and things like that?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:12:07] <strong>Courtney Robertson:</strong> Good question. We began our delve into third party plugins at WordCamp US in 2015. Those that have been around a while may know this. If you wanted to add some custom CSS to a site, before the customizer had it available, we needed Jetpack to do that. So as a team, we essentially indicated we want to make use of third party plugins.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The parameters need to be that it&#8217;s in the wordpress.org repo. As things have launched, our main focus has started really with how to use WordPress to put a basic site together. However our audience for who can learn help is really vast. So we&#8217;ve formed some guidelines around third party plugins, and also for those that are hosting some social learning spaces. If somebody volunteers to host one, and many folks do volunteer to host those, we can&#8217;t be overly self-promotional, and if we are mentioning in any of our training materials, any type of plugin or something to that effect, that it be available, plugins, themes, be available through wordpress.org.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>We try to draw on the theme unit test data for our dummy content. We use the photos repo for our media. We use the showcase for showing off what WordPress is capable of doing. So we reference our own material as absolutely much as possible in that process, and have some just general guidelines for how we can cover the material safely for everybody.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:13:37] <strong>Nathan Wrigley:</strong> Yeah, I feel that you&#8217;ve answered that really comprehensively. It feels very much like the same kind of constraints that we might have if we were, for example, putting on a WordCamp or something. The nature of the conversation that we could have as a presenter would feel like it&#8217;s falling under the same kind of boundaries.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Yeah, that&#8217;s really cleared it up, thank you. Now, the project itself, the WordPress project, as I just alluded to a minute ago, it is really changed over the last few years. If you roll back the clock five or six years, the way WordPress behaved, the way that you created content is now completely different.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And we&#8217;ve got all sorts of things which are coming down the pipe and they&#8217;re coming thick and fast. Things like full site editing and all of that kind of stuff. I&#8217;m just wondering what your priority list is? It feels to me like this question is basically asking what&#8217;s the roadmap? What kind of things that you&#8217;re prioritizing? Because there must be a limited amount of hours in everybody&#8217;s day that&#8217;s connected to the team and you&#8217;ve got to decide, okay, this feels like it matters more right now. Can you give us some idea about what are you thinking for the learn platform in the near future?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:14:40] <strong>Courtney Robertson:</strong> Yeah, that&#8217;s a great question. So our team is comprised of both sponsored and self-sponsored or volunteers in all capacities. So that looks like there are a few folks that are sponsored by Automattic led by Hugh Lashbrooke, to be part of our team, as well as delightful project manager, Hauwa Abashir, and a plugin co-founder Pooja Derashri.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And so that&#8217;s the core of our team. However, we have a lot of contributors and I say this first, because in open source, we can have some high-level type of priorities, but as you know, when it comes to people volunteering to do something, they&#8217;ll volunteer to what they want to do, and they&#8217;re not going to volunteer for what doesn&#8217;t interest them all the time.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>So with our priorities, we have a few ways of looking at priorities. The content priority is lately focused on doing as much as we can that is geared towards a release as close to release as possible. We have some great ways of trying to work a little bit into the future. So that right now we&#8217;re already preparing material that will come out with the next release.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>That would be 6.0 at the time of today&#8217;s recording. But we also have some other priorities as well, as you can imagine. We&#8217;re managing a website, a large website that is on a massive multi-site install. And so some of those other priorities look like, we just moved the team from Trello over to GitHub to help track all of the activity of what we&#8217;re creating and what our roadmap actually looks like and what our priorities are. That also helps surface our activity and contribution to the project, because that too then will help track with our .org profiles.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>We have some needs, some really big needs coming up. There is ideas around merging lesson plans and workshops. So that would be the instructional materials as well as the video that coincides with it, that would need to develop a resourcing. We would like to do a little bit more with the UX. We had a UX audit come back and we would like to do some more with the front of site. But again, that too would need some developer lift.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And at this time our theme is not block-based and in our case, that could be helpful for us to help lay out that content in a way that would be more beneficial for learners as they come in. To find our roadmap, there will be lots of show notes available. To find our roadmaps, we have a few places, and I know that seems a little tricky. Go to make.wordpress.org/training, and from there, you&#8217;ll find a big blue box that talks about the training team&#8217;s goals for 2022. One of the next goals aside from content is a needs analysis. So that means actually talking to the WordPress community and saying, everything from a hobbyist, a small business owner to a large scale enterprise level agency.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>What do you need for training your staff? How can we help you reach those goals? What do you think the highest priority of content should be? And in what order should that happen? Get the feedback of what actually matters. And what&#8217;s going to be most beneficial. Who&#8217;s using this and how can we make it better?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>We also have sprints, and those sprints are, what are we working on just this month that is both content or the other annual goal type of projects? And so each month we&#8217;ll publish at the beginning of the month, what we&#8217;re doing this month, and at the end of the month, we&#8217;ll post a recap. How did it go? What did we get done? And we have our issues in GitHub and there&#8217;ll be some links available for those too. So if you want to see what&#8217;s the highest priority thing that I can contribute to, you could go right to our GitHub repo that shows you exactly that issue.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:18:23] <strong>Nathan Wrigley:</strong> I have to say Courtney, you&#8217;ve done a fabulous job of giving me links. Virtually everything that Courtney is mentioning is going to be referenced in the show notes. So firstly Bravo, thank you for making my life easier and doing that. That&#8217;s brilliant. But just to say if you are curious about any of these bits, you&#8217;ll be able to find a portion in the show notes, which relates to each of the questions that we&#8217;re asking and in most cases there&#8217;s several links to follow through there.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>I&#8217;m just going to ask a question related to what we&#8217;ve just talked about, and that is, I&#8217;m going to use an example, and the example I&#8217;m using is the BBC, which is the British Broadcasting Corporation. The BBC is funded by tax payers essentially. We all have to contribute if we have a television set, and because of the fact that we&#8217;re all contributing there&#8217;s a thing called the BBC charter, and the BBC charter, now it may be imperfect, but it&#8217;s what they got. The charter compels the BBC to make programming for everybody.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>So it may be that there&#8217;s a giant audience for this type of program, and there&#8217;s a considerably smaller audience for this type of programming, but the charter, in theory, compels the BBC to make programming despite the fact that the audience may be smaller. You can see where I&#8217;m going with this probably. I&#8217;m just wondering if you have any of those kinds of things. Does it always come down to the numbers? In other words, if you can see that there&#8217;s a giant need for this, because everybody&#8217;s clamoring for this kind of tutorial or whatever, well, that&#8217;s obviously important, but there may be something over here, a bit of an edge case, really truly crucial to the people who need it, though their numbers may be small. I&#8217;m just wondering if there&#8217;s any those, kind of, bits that fit into the bigger jigsaw.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:20:02] <strong>Courtney Robertson:</strong> They do. Those are areas that we would often allow the individual that has such an idea for that topic to help develop. Because again, open source, we allow the contributors that would like to do something. If they say this is the one thing that I am willing to do, then, okay then, we&#8217;ll work with that.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>That said we do have some priorities as you indicated, but some things will work across multiple pathways. And so by a learning pathway, what I mean is, if you think about who can learn help, and there&#8217;s actually a post that is cross-referenced to something that Josepha had helped create. I want to say it was about two years ago.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>When you think about all the edge cases of who can WordPress help, how is WordPress used? Josepha and Mark Uraine wrote a piece on make WordPress updates awhile ago about care and influence, a theory about the WordPress community. And it&#8217;s this broken down idea that we have, Core, central folks contributing. Then we have contributors on the project. We have extenders that are using WordPress. That will be what we&#8217;re doing right now. That&#8217;d be like a podcast about WordPress. Users of sites and also visitors of sites. And so when you break that down into actual kinds of careers or professions, or even just hobbyists, right?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>That is a lot of things. In the extenders category you have podcasters and you have newsletters, and you&#8217;ve got people that use WordPress for marketing purposes. Some are developers, some are in quality assurance. Some are support staff at companies. So who can learn help? Well, there&#8217;s a lot of varying needs like that.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And I could see a lot of those edge cases that you mention, still applying to a lot of people. So learns really important. I think that learn is a great tool to help folks into not just the community in terms of events, but the community in terms of understanding what can I do with WordPress? And if WordPress is related to my profession, what do I need to know, and how can I best leverage, what learn has to offer to help me get there.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:22:11] <strong>Nathan Wrigley:</strong> Yeah, thank you. Okay, let&#8217;s move on to the people who may be asking those questions of you. If I was to come to you and I had a particular topic in mind, and there was something that was really troubling me, and I wanted to get to the bottom of it. Are there any ways that I can ask, I don&#8217;t know, beg, plead maybe the right words for certain content to be created?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:22:31] <strong>Courtney Robertson:</strong> Yes. So one of the ways is that if you need a little bit of extra help in doing that, if you are able to get to the make WordPress Slack and the training team inside of that, and you can find the link again from the training team site at make.wordpress.org/training. We are glad to give a little extra hand holding through that process.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The other thing that we welcome folks to do is, go to our GitHub repo and submit a topic as a lesson plan idea. That does not mean that you need to create the lesson plan. If you would like to help create that or create a workshop, you may absolutely do that. But if it&#8217;s just, I have this one idea, this one thing, or I have got a vision for a course, and I could tell you every step along the way of what needs to go into the course, we are happy to work with you in that process.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>So we would begin with starting an issue in our GitHub repo and to be clear, if you&#8217;re not accustomed to GitHub, it&#8217;s about on par with submitting a form or a comment on a site. So our way of submitting an issue will look similar to that. You&#8217;ll get some preloaded template that asks you to fill in a little bit more information for us. And then we&#8217;ve got that idea of ready to go.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:23:44] <strong>Nathan Wrigley:</strong> Yeah, GetHub can be very intimidating to look at can&#8217;t it, if you&#8217;re there for the time, but like you say, it&#8217;s merely a, a set of comments, so, oh, that&#8217;s really helpful, thank you. In terms of who is making the content, how the content is made, what does that look like? I&#8217;m going to sort of cross two questions here, and we&#8217;ll get onto learning paths and things like that, but just wondering, who&#8217;s actually putting the content together.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Do you have particular panel, do you give certain members of the team the job of going away and create a video for that particular thing based upon these guidelines? Is it always the same people or can other people contribute their content? In other words, could I contribute my content? And if that was the case, are there any guidelines that would be helpful to know about?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>I mean, there&#8217;s obviously going to be things which are out of the remit, boundaries that I shouldn&#8217;t cross and probably ways that you would prefer me to curate that content.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:24:35] <strong>Courtney Robertson:</strong> Yeah, absolutely. I would love to have you create a video. I love listening to your voice. Anyone is most welcome to help create that content. In fact, when learn launched, because we had this stockpile of lesson plans over the years, I counted nearly 200 contributors, at the launch of learn that had contributed over the years to the training team. That&#8217;s a staggering number for the work that we did.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And I think back at all of those WordCamps when we had contributor days and all the folks that we met. It was great. So we have lots of people help create the content. But as you can imagine, during Covid, a lot of activity came to an absolute halt. I myself just resurfaced within contributing during that time, and none of the folks were around or available then. Literally no meetings had happened for several months and I had a hard time finding folks. We&#8217;ve grown since then, a lot. And the folks that are contributing these days, as I mentioned, there is a contingent of folks by Automattic that are contributing.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>I am there a good bit as well by making content, but we have a lot of people that are not sponsored. And I had spent about seven years in that category myself. And so I want to be very thoughtful. We&#8217;ve got a lot of folks that are absolutely delightful to work with. Speaking highly of my team reps as well.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>They do contribute so much in the way of content and proofreading. We open up opportunities to help folks proofread the material that goes out or create some feedback for others that are creating that content. So anybody is welcome to help come and make this stuff too.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:26:12] <strong>Nathan Wrigley:</strong> In terms of the guidelines though, what would cut muster for inclusion? Presumably there&#8217;s barriers in terms of, okay, that&#8217;s too short. That&#8217;s far too long. The quality of the audio there is too poor. I think we probably could have covered the topic in half the time or whatever it may be. There are probably guidelines for keeping the quality high.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:26:31] <strong>Courtney Robertson:</strong> That is true. We are working on improving that quality, and we do have a post that I did not provide a link to it ahead of time, and I will dig that back out for you. But it is basically the idea when we first launched, we&#8217;re new, in terms of creating videos. We&#8217;re new in terms of creating courses and let&#8217;s get going and learn as we go, what we&#8217;re doing.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Our earliest videos, we learned a lot about needing to keep content current with revisions. That&#8217;s a really big struggle. When WordPress ships a big update, we have to come back and revise things. Also we have learned a good bit about, if we need the person&#8217;s video, their face on screen or not, about how to create these videos.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The kind of quality that we&#8217;re looking for. We are flexible still within those parameters. In fact, one of our highest videos, I think was done during a contributor session for WordCamp India. And there was a bit of background it. So we&#8217;re learning. As we make learn, we&#8217;re learning and we would love to have lots of global representation. We would love to have a high quality production to it, but we&#8217;ll help each other get through that process.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:27:43] <strong>Nathan Wrigley:</strong> I love the meta there. We&#8217;re learning to learn. That&#8217;s brilliant. The different formats that you do, actually no, I&#8217;ll come back to that in a moment. I&#8217;m going to ask about the way that your team meets, because we&#8217;re currently talking about people contributing their time, and you mentioned that you can go and do things like contribute in GitHub with comments and so on.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>But I&#8217;m just wondering if you became much more involved in the team and you were there regularly, not just committing a piece of content once in a while, but really digging into the team and trying to help out on a regular basis. It would be quite helpful to know what that might look like. Where do you hang out? Where do you do the work?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:28:17] <strong>Courtney Robertson:</strong> Sure. So, forgive my American mindset about time, but on Tuesdays at noon Eastern time. On Thursdays at 7:30 AM Eastern or, oh, I forget exactly what time it is for Pooja, but she runs an APAC specific time zone meeting. And so it&#8217;s the same time and option available for both of these meetings. Those happen by the way, all in Slack, those are entirely Slack based chat messages, as you would find across the 20 now different WordPress teams. We conduct our meetings through Slack. We have coffee hours as a get to know folks session. Those are delightful to stop by and see. We&#8217;re running those Fridays at 9:00 AM Eastern. However, we are open to exploring alternative times for that.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>We&#8217;ve got some folks that are traveling that are our normals that help conduct these. So we&#8217;ll give it a few more weeks before we start looking into different time zones. We do those through Zoom. We find that that generally meets the most accessible needs and we have the accessibility team rep often join us too. So that&#8217;s delightful. And then you can find us, hopefully in the near future at a WordCamp close to you at a contributor day.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:29:31] <strong>Nathan Wrigley:</strong> That would be nice.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:29:32] <strong>Courtney Robertson:</strong> Yes.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:29:33] <strong>Nathan Wrigley:</strong> Let&#8217;s hope that&#8217;s true. Now my understanding is that broadly speaking people fall into different types of learners. You may be kinesthetic, or you may be auditory or visual or what have you. That is going to inevitably lead to people, desiring different types of content. And you mentioned a moment ago, you called it learning paths, I think you said. What different formats have you got? I mean it may be that that is still to be explored. Maybe you&#8217;re going to invest time and effort into different things in the future, but whether you&#8217;ve got it live at the moment or whether it&#8217;s just a, an aspiration, tell us the thinking behind that.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:30:06] <strong>Courtney Robertson:</strong> Yeah. Our content types, are lesson plans, workshops, courses, and social learning spaces. Our audience is quite vast, but then if you break it down into an individual, an individual may learn in different methods. So some folks really like videos. Some people really like to read, like it&#8217;s a book. And so our courses approach different learning styles.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And the more that we can do that, the better. Our courses do suggest projects to extend upon what you&#8217;ve already learned. So often that would look like doing the work along with the course, and that would be delivered both in text and video form. And then having a suggested, now here&#8217;s a challenge to try on your own. To give you that hands-on experience without being guided. The more ways that we can continue to help cater to individual learning styles, the better.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Also along those lines my teaching hat background comes in here. It really matters to me that we are available in the global space. And so that also looks like translation opportunities, because one of the things about learning styles is that, if you think about folks in, you and I both speak English. English second language individuals, that would be a student in a school whose first language was not English often needs a little extra support when they&#8217;re just beginning to be immersed English.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And so, I don&#8217;t find it to be particularly reasonable or fair that somebody that is not primarily English is only presented training materials in English. We need a lot of support around getting the content available in as many languages as we possibly can. We also need then to help work on the initiatives that WordPress has to be multi-lingual.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>So at this time that&#8217;s on the roadmap, but it&#8217;s not until I think phase four in the Gutenberg project to be fully multilingual. So that presents a challenge then on Learn, because how do we make our courses available in different languages? We need some help.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:32:08] <strong>Nathan Wrigley:</strong> Well, let&#8217;s hope that somebody listening to this is, uh, is going to step in and assist you with that. Just a thing, I may be jumping the gun here, and it may be something that you&#8217;re unable to talk about. You mentioned in our exchanges prior to recording that there was potentially in the future, some path towards certification. So I&#8217;m guessing, you know, you put the time in, and as a result, you are handed something in exchange to prove that you pass the test, if you like. You achieved what it was and you got through it all. Just tell us the thinking on that, even if none of it&#8217;s particularly concrete right now.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:32:42] <strong>Courtney Robertson:</strong> Yeah. So this is a podcast for WP Tavern. If you&#8217;re interested in the history of WordPress entertaining the idea of certification, you may search the archives here. I will say that certification as we see it. I also had some questions about several years ago, I would say, but what changed my mind first and foremost was that when I was teaching in the bootcamp and I presented to my leaders, here&#8217;s what individuals need to be job ready, and here&#8217;s the timeframe that that could be delivered in and what would be adequate for the amount of each programming language, plus then how WordPress pulls that together. It wasn&#8217;t provided, it was a challenge then to get individuals placed for jobs.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The resourcing for such material wasn&#8217;t readily available. So having a definitive here is what it would take to being basically job ready as a common industry accepted standard suddenly became a high priority in my mind. I realized, oh, if that was in place, it would be really easy to point to and say, here&#8217;s what folks need to be able to do. And here&#8217;s a pathway for how to learn that.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>So at this time we are not ready to begin starting a certification initiative. We are looking in quarter four of this year. So the last three months of 2022, of beginning, a discovery session. A discovery session means to, again, talk to folks about what they need, what their concerns are. Also look at other open source projects and see what worked and what didn&#8217;t work.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>I&#8217;ve been checking in with the folks that help form the certification over at Joomla. And I&#8217;m learning a bit about what has and has not worked for them. I&#8217;m keeping loose eyes on what Drupal is doing, but I think there&#8217;s something to learn from other open source initiatives that are not even about a content management system.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>So look at how do they do this? What have they learned? How would that potentially work for us? Would that work for us? What other concerns does the community have? So, disclaimer, folks. Yes, this is a hot topic. Yes, it&#8217;s had a history. We&#8217;re interested. We want to talk. That&#8217;s where we&#8217;re at at this time. We want to talk about it and the conversations happening starting around October of 2022.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:34:59] <strong>Nathan Wrigley:</strong> Oh, a perfect time for us to release this then. You&#8217;ve got the people thinking about that in time for October. That&#8217;s fabulous. You mentioned earlier about resources for the learn project. And again, I don&#8217;t know if you&#8217;ve got an insight to deliver here. I&#8217;m just wondering how it is, how it is all funded essentially. Now you mentioned that your seconded from GoDaddy, forgive me the word wasn&#8217;t seconded it was whatever it was. GoDaddy provide you with the financial support so that you can lend your time to the project. What other resources are brought to bear. You mentioned that other people were seconded, there were volunteers and so on, but</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:35:37] <strong>Courtney Robertson:</strong> Yeah.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:35:37] <strong>Nathan Wrigley:</strong> Is there anything else? Are there pots of money, which you can dip into provided by, I don&#8217;t know, sponsorship or different organizations who contribute to the project.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:35:47] <strong>Courtney Robertson:</strong> Wouldn&#8217;t that be delightful if I just had unlimited money to use on this. Oh, where could we go? So our team does have some resources provided for our team. In addition to, there are contributors across multiple other organizations, I will say as well, that do periodically pop by for some contribution to the project as well.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>But we do have some resources. So a lot of teams in WordPress use Helpscout. Even Slack itself is a paid Slack instance, and I could be mistaken, but I believe that a lot of that financial work overhead is through Automattic. I would love to be corrected if so. We are using Sensei Pro, which is a learning management system. It is a plugin. The pro version just recently released, but that is owned by Automattic. Sensei has been an Automattic product for about 10 years. We do have an access through VideoPress. Should we need it? And VideoPress for WordPress TV is also how we embed our videos. So again, those two are provided through Automattic with Jetpack.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Meetups that would run through WordCamp central. We recently received both WP Sandbox and Insta WP as options that we can use. So when somebody is going through a course, when we&#8217;re new to learning WordPress, the hardest challenge is to get a WordPress environment set up. And with both of these tools, we are able to, whether it is social learning spaces or courses or something to that effect. We&#8217;re able to very quickly get folks a single link that takes them to WordPress install. That&#8217;s got today&#8217;s theme, plugin and some demo content ready to go so they can get to work on doing the activity, not be stumped by how to set WordPress up. So those are fantastic resources that we do have available at this time.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:37:30] <strong>Nathan Wrigley:</strong> Thank you very much. Is there anything else that I failed to ask you? Obviously, you know, you&#8217;ve really deeply embedded in this project and I&#8217;ve asked the questions that I wish to ask, but quite happy for you to tell us about something that I missed.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:37:43] <strong>Courtney Robertson:</strong> Sure, I mentioned that we focused in early on, on just getting started using WordPress, but we make space for all of these other types of things that folks might want to learn how to do with WordPress. There&#8217;s really almost no limit, other than if we&#8217;re mentioning a plugin or a theme, keep it within WordPress dot org, so other people can access it and use it.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>But we do have some beginning workings of a developer content roadmap. I began forming this when I was planning what I needed to do at the front end dev bootcamp. I looked at it like at what point along the journey from installing WordPress and activating Hello Dolly to I&#8217;m going to build a multi-site WordPress instance, that power s thousands of sub-sites or something like that.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>How do you learn how to do all of these things? How do you begin learning? At what point do you learn APIs? What about build tools like Webpack. Those that are high into development with no, oh yeah, at some point I learned this and that, and what logically would happen with that?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>So we do have a higher level, how to learn everything from just getting started all the way through, I want you to do the most complex possible things available there. And I&#8217;m really excited that we will soon be joined by Jonathan Bossenger, as a developer educator. He is coming in again, sponsored by Automattic.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And will be contributing developer oriented content. So that, that roadmap that I began laying down while at the bootcamp will hopefully come into play with creating more dev oriented content. If you&#8217;re interested in seeing what is everything in a logical order, again, challenge, we, we need dev resourcing to help develop the site as well here.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>So we have a pathway that is everything that we have made available. And it&#8217;s in a logical order, but it&#8217;s just a table at this time until we can get some more development on the site. So there&#8217;s a learn pathway link that I can provide. And then finally, again, the call-out is there, contribute, contribute.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>We love to partner with folks along the way. I know this is a lot. I&#8217;m coming in as a former second generation computer teacher. So I have a bit of a runway and I&#8217;ve been working with the project since 2013. We&#8217;ve talked about a lot today. It seems a lot of a lot. We&#8217;re happy to help slow it down and connect you with exactly where you need to go. Because again, our team is made up of a lot of folks that think like teachers.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:40:16] <strong>Nathan Wrigley:</strong> In the course of this podcast, we&#8217;ve mentioned so much as you described, just to reiterate, if you&#8217;ve been listening to this podcast and you, you know, you&#8217;re maybe listening to it on your headphones whilst you&#8217;re driving the car or something like that. Don&#8217;t forget that the show notes will have all the links that Courtney&#8217;s provided and hopefully you&#8217;ll be able to get to the exact thing that piqued your interest. However Courtney, there&#8217;s one thing missing off those show notes, and that would be how we might contact you. If somebody has a need to speak to you on the back of this podcast, what&#8217;s the preferred way or ways of getting in touch?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:40:51] <strong>Courtney Robertson:</strong> Yeah, so to help lighten the load, if it is specific to the training team or learn, please swing through the channel inside of make.wordpress.org/training. You&#8217;ll find our link to get to our Slack channel there. That helps the right folks get connected with you, so if it&#8217;s a general team question. If you would like to find me specifically courtneyr_dev on Twitter, Courtney Robertson on LinkedIn, courtneyr.dev is my website. You can find everywhere I am there.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:41:19] <strong>Nathan Wrigley:</strong> Courtney Robertson thank you for joining us on the podcast today.

Catch Themes&#8217; first block-based theme, <a href=\"https://wordpress.org/themes/catch-fse/\">Catch FSE</a>, landed on WordPress.org over the weekend.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The company is one of the most prolific authors in the official WordPress theme directory, touting a <a href=\"https://wordpress.org/themes/author/catchthemes/\">total of 109 themes</a>. There are only a few others with such an impressive body of work, at least in sheer numbers. Averaging over 10 new releases each year for the last decade is no small feat, and that just accounts for the company&#8217;s free themes.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>At a time when WordPress is still in a transitioning phase between classic, PHP-based themes and those built entirely from blocks, the community needs leaders in the space pushing the project forward.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>With WordPress 6.0&#8217;s slew of features, I expect we will see more and more authors join the ride.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>When reviewing new themes, I typically install them a few days ahead of time and test them off and on. Then, I decide if they are worth sharing with the Tavern audience. However, in this case, I am going in blind. Well, not <em>entirely</em> blind. I am familiar enough with some of Catch Themes&#8217; past work to know the company has produced some well-designed projects. Plus, I had quickly peeked at the demo.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>My immediate reaction after installing and activating Catch FSE was disappointment. The homepage did not look like the theme&#8217;s screenshot or what was <a href=\"https://fse.catchthemes.com/catch-fse/\">shown in the demo</a>. Instead of the business-friendly layout I expected, I gazed upon a standard blog post listing.</p>\n\n\n\n<img />Default homepage blog posts.\n\n\n\n<p>This should not be happening in the block themes era.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Theme authors are not entirely at fault for this problem. Those who have submitted their designs to WordPress.org have been conditioned over the years to do this. This was a necessity in the classic theme era because users did not have the same control as they do now over their homepages. The site editor gives them that freedom, and it also breaks the shackles that have been holding theme authors back for years.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Now is the time to be bold. Now is the time for theme authors to put their signature on their work, showcasing their design skills with those custom homepages they have always wanted to provide out of the box. Now is the time to break free of those draconian guidelines from an era that block-based themes are leaving behind.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Catch Themes, if you are reading this, I want to see a <code>front-page.html</code> template in version 2.0 that outputs the following:</p>\n\n\n\n<img />Homepage design from the Catch FSE demo.\n\n\n\n<p>Give users an immediate solution instead of forcing them to create a new page, select a template, and move into the template editor to customize it.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>A blog post listing is a perfectly acceptable default for a theme, and Catch FSE&#8217;s works well enough&#8212;<em>those gradient &#8220;read more&#8221; buttons are also sweet</em>. However, if the screenshot and demo showcase a custom homepage, that is what I expect to see upon activation. And, based on my somewhat educated guess, it is also what the average user will expect.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>After tinkering around with the theme for a while longer, I realized how well-designed it was. The typography made for an enjoyable reading experience. Each template was well laid out. The footer &#8220;widgets&#8221; even felt right. Catch FSE was suddenly making a beeline toward the top of my favorite themes list this year.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And, I must take another moment to appreciate the gradient used for buttons in the theme, as shown in this screenshot of the About Us pattern:</p>\n\n\n\n<img />&#8220;About Us&#8221; block pattern.\n\n\n\n<p>Those who have followed me long enough know that I often dislike dark designs. Automattic&#8217;s Livro made me <a href=\"https://wptavern.com/automattics-livro-is-a-minimal-block-theme-for-writers\">rethink my position</a> earlier this year. With Catch FSE, I am moving beyond merely tolerating such designs to enjoying them. <em>Well, some of them. Let&#8217;s not get crazy.</em></p>\n\n\n\n<p>What Catch FSE does as well as any theme is offer a well-designed set of block patterns. In total, it ships 15 that users can pick and choose from.</p>\n\n\n\n<img />Inserting a call-to-action pattern in the page editor.\n\n\n\n<p>From a development perspective, other theme authors should take notes. Following the DRY principle, Catch FSE routinely reuses its own patterns in its templates and parts.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The theme registers 10 block styles, but it is impossible to know what most of them do without trying them out first. The user-facing label simply reads &#8220;Theme Style&#8221; for eight of them. <em>What does that even mean? If it is <strong>the</strong> theme style, should it not be the default?</em></p>\n\n\n\n<p>Most are generally design variations for the various blocks they are attached to. They might alter the typography, colors, or other styles, as shown in the following screenshot of the Blockquote block with the &#8220;Theme Style&#8221; assigned to it:</p>\n\n\n\n<img />Assigning a custom style to the Blockquote block.\n\n\n\n<p>That is actually a well-designed Blockquote style, but I would have never known it was something I would want to use if I had not been digging. Custom block styles suffer from a bit of a discoverability problem by default, and cryptic names for them are doing users no favors.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Most of the issues I had with the theme were around the comments list design. However, it is not yet using the new Comments Query Loop block shipping with WordPress 6.0. In a future release, I would like to see the author put more time into bringing it up to par with the rest of the theme&#8217;s design. At the moment, it feels like a feature that was tacked on as an afterthought.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Catch FSE is a freemium theme with a commercial <a href=\"https://catchthemes.com/fse-pro-plugin/\">add-on plugin</a> that offers three custom blocks and 10 patterns. I like seeing the upsells focused purely on value-adds.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>I have often said that the next generation of freemium themes cannot be like the last. Developers will need to focus on enticing users with solutions to their problems instead of nickel-and-diming customers, locking necessary features behind a paywall. The block system is changing the game, and when most users can flesh out their site designs via the built-in WordPress site editor, the old-school upsells will not cut it.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Turnkey, plug-n-play solutions are needed. I may be so far off-base that I am not even in the ballpark, but I foresee block patterns being a central part of that. Once commercial theme authors figure out how to market and build with these new tools, we will see an explosion of growth in the block-based themes space.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Catch Themes&#8217; 10 commercial patterns represent a start, but I imagine the company will need to continue pushing limits to see a worthwhile return on its premium upsell. Now is the time for experimentation while the field is wide open.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>My biggest nit-pick?</em> The name.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Attention all developers:</strong> Can we stop naming themes &#8220;Something FSE&#8221; and &#8220;Guten Something&#8221;? It is confusing and makes it tough to remember which project is which. Take some time to come up with something that stands out in the crowd.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Catch FSE is a bold and beautiful business-ready theme, but it needed a name to match its personality. I only hope folks remember it.</p>\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:7:\"pubDate\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:31:\"Wed, 11 May 2022 03:27:27 +0000\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}s:32:\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\";a:1:{s:7:\"creator\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:14:\"Justin Tadlock\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}}}i:40;a:6:{s:4:\"data\";s:13:\"\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";s:5:\"child\";a:2:{s:0:\"\";a:5:{s:5:\"title\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:78:\"WPTavern: WPSiteSync Shuts Down, Commercial Extensions Now Available on GitHub\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"guid\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:30:\"https://wptavern.com/?p=134205\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"link\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:88:\"https://wptavern.com/wpsitesync-shuts-down-commercial-extensions-now-available-on-github\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:11:\"description\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:4898:\"<p><a href=\"https://wpsitesync.com/\">WPSiteSync</a>, a content syncing plugin from the team behind DesktopServer, has discontinued support for its free, core plugin and commercial extensions. The plugin lets users sync specific content, such as posts, pages, featured images, and taxonomies, without having to migrate the entire database. Commercial <a href=\"https://wpsitesync.com/downloads/\">extensions</a> allowed users to sync things like WooCommerce products, Gutenberg blocks, EDD product information, custom post types, Beaver Builder projects, and more.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>It has been nine months since the <a href=\"https://wordpress.org/plugins/wpsitesynccontent/\">WPSiteSync plugin</a> was updated and more than a year since a major release. After six years, the ServerPress team has published a statement explaining their reasons for shutting down:</p>\n\n\n\n<blockquote class=\"wp-block-quote\"><p>After a lot of consideration and discussion, we have concluded that we will no longer be updating WPSiteSync and its Premium Extensions. This was a difficult decision for us to make as we know that many of you rely on it in order to enhance your WordPress Workflow. The decision was made due to the fact that with each extension being dependent on the code of the plugin that it supports, we could not keep up with their changes as we enhanced our library, and frankly, there was not as much demand for it as we had hoped. Additionally, we found that our time supporting WPSiteSync took away from our ability to move our flagship product, DesktopServer, forward.</p></blockquote>\n\n\n\n<p>The ServerPress team plans to integrate some of WPSiteSync&#8217;s functionality into its DestopServer product and is making the current iteration of the plugin and all of its commercial extensions <a href=\"https://github.com/ServerPress\">available for free on GitHub</a>. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>PublishPress founder Steve Burge, whose business followed a similar monetization path, commented that WPSiteSync chose &#8220;an honorable and honest way to end the commercial life of a WordPress plugin.&#8221; He said his company considered a similar set of features &#8220;but it seemed as daunting as they describe.&#8221; </p>\n\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-embed__wrapper\">\n<blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\"><p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\">This is an honorable and honest way to end the commercial life of a WordPress plugin: <a href=\"https://t.co/DQ1dKnjvMC\">https://t.co/DQ1dKnjvMC</a><br /><br />(We\'d considered a similar set of features for PublishPress, but it seemed as daunting as they describe)</p>&mdash; Steve Burge (@SteveJBurge) <a href=\"https://twitter.com/SteveJBurge/status/1523748197943848962?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">May 9, 2022</a></blockquote>\n</div>\n\n\n\n<p>The free core with commercial extensions business model can work well, but it can also stretch a development team thin if they are also responsible for a flagship product on top of maintaining such a diverse set of extensions. Keeping up with changes in Gutenberg, WooCommerce, Beaver Builder, EDD, and many other fast-moving plugins is an ambitious endeavor. It&#8217;s easy to see how the support and maintenance of these extensions could become untenable.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>&#8220;Just as an example, the Advanced Custom Fields extension might take X number of hours to code and then they might make one small change in how it writes to the database and then our extension would lose its functionality,&#8221; ServerPress Operations Director Marc Benzakein told the Tavern. &#8220;This often meant that instead of continually sticking with a production schedule, we would have to change our focus to support the ACF plugin. The more plugins WPSiteSync supported, the more untenable it became and the more man-hours it took to support it.&#8221; </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Benzakein also said another reason ServerPress decided not to sell is because they are exploring the idea of approaching it from a more manageable direction, to have WPSiteSync features available as an integration into their other workflow tool. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>WPSiteSync has hovered at approximately 3,000 active installs for the past two years. Putting the plugin and extensions on GitHub gives WPSiteSync and its extensions the opportunity to be forked and supported by a new team with more incentive and resources. Shutting down may be disappointing for current users and customers, but, after so long without updates, it&#8217;s better that the software is officially released to the public for a chance at new life.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Customers who purchased WPSiteSync&#8217;s &#8220;Premium Bundle&#8221; within the last 30 days can request a refund. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>&#8220;We will support our current customers as far as we can,&#8221; Benzakein said. &#8220;By and large the plugin and its extensions still work and the core plugin, which is available on the repo, will likely continue to work for some time as well.&#8221;</p>\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:7:\"pubDate\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:31:\"Tue, 10 May 2022 22:15:11 +0000\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}s:32:\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\";a:1:{s:7:\"creator\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:13:\"Sarah Gooding\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}}}i:41;a:6:{s:4:\"data\";s:13:\"\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";s:5:\"child\";a:2:{s:0:\"\";a:5:{s:5:\"title\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:39:\"Post Status: Celebrate Small Businesses\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"guid\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:31:\"https://poststatus.com/?p=97393\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"link\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:50:\"https://poststatus.com/celebrate-small-businesses/\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:11:\"description\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:1128:\"<p class=\"has-drop-cap\">There are 455,000,000+ websites running WordPress.

However, one of the more advanced tools is the ability to lock blocks, which can be used to prevent specific blocks from being moved or removed.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The upcoming release includes a new &#8220;Lock&#8221; setting in the block toolbar&#8217;s options dropdown, as shown in the following screenshot:</p>\n\n\n\n<img />Selecting the Lock option from the block toolbar.\n\n\n\n<p>Once clicking the lock option, a modal appears that allows the user to disable movement of the block or prevent its removal:</p>\n\n\n\n<img />Block locking options.\n\n\n\n<p>Thus far, the best use case I have found for locking blocks via the UI is to stop accidental edits. Because users have access to the UI settings by default, they can disable the lock later if I need to move something around the layout or delete it.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>On the surface, this may not seem like a particularly robust feature. However, the real power of block locking is on the development end. Theme authors can use the new <code>lock</code> key to prevent end-users from moving or removing specific blocks in their templates.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The following code is an example of a Group block that prevents both:</p>\n\n\n\n<pre class=\"wp-block-code\"><code>&lt;!-- wp:group {\"lock\":{\"move\":true,\"remove\":true}} -->\n\n&lt;!-- /wp:group --></code></pre>\n\n\n\n<p>This can be especially handy for more complex layouts, such as a header and navigation area. Theme authors can now exert more control over the user experience in places where the design might easily be broken.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Note that locking does not trickle down to nested blocks. Therefore, if an outer Group block is locked, users can still add, remove, or move anything inside it. Themers must also add a lock to any nested items they want to keep in place. There is an open ticket and some early design work around <a href=\"https://github.com/WordPress/gutenberg/issues/40069\">locking nested blocks</a>, but it will not land in WordPress 6.0.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>While this new feature offers more control for theme authors, it does not grant absolute power. Users can still unlock blocks by clicking the lock icon in the toolbar. However, as is the common saying in WordPress development circles, &#8220;There is a hook for that.&#8221;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>George Mamadashvili <a href=\"https://make.wordpress.org/core/2022/05/05/block-locking-settings-in-wordpress-6-0/\">covered using the <code>block_editor_settings_all</code> filter hook</a> to customize access. He provided a few examples of enabling or disabling the UI based on capabilities, user email, and context, such as the post type. There is no limit on how developers can use this hook. In general, capability checks are typically the best option when dealing with permissions.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>A developer could disable any user&#8217;s ability to move or remove blocks. In real-world cases, this should help agencies and freelancers create tightly-controlled experiences for their clients, especially when handing over access to the site editor.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>For developers who are building themes for release on WordPress.org, the Themes Team currently disallows using this hook. It falls under the &#8220;plugin territory&#8221; guideline. Last month, <a href=\"https://make.wordpress.org/themes/2022/04/26/themes-team-meeting-notes-april-26-2022/\">the team announced</a> that themes could lock blocks but not disable the user&#8217;s ability to unlock them.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Block locking is not limited to block-based templates. It is also possible to lock things down within posts or pages. With a custom permissions setup, developers could extend it to give administrators and editors free rein while preventing authors and contributors from overriding locks, for example.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>By default, all blocks support locking. For plugin developers who want to opt-out of this feature, they can set the <code>supports.lock</code> key to <code>false</code> in their <code>block.json</code> file.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>I am eager to see new WordPress plugins built on this system. There is plenty of room to explore from site customization and editing flow angles.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>For further reading, check out Anne McCarthy&#8217;s post on creating <a href=\"https://make.wordpress.org/core/2022/02/09/core-editor-improvement-curated-experiences-with-locking-apis-theme-json/\">curated experiences with locking APIs and theme.json</a>.</p>\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:7:\"pubDate\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:31:\"Tue, 10 May 2022 04:52:43 +0000\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}s:32:\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\";a:1:{s:7:\"creator\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:14:\"Justin Tadlock\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}}}i:45;a:6:{s:4:\"data\";s:13:\"\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";s:5:\"child\";a:2:{s:0:\"\";a:5:{s:5:\"title\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:69:\"WPTavern: Ulysses App Updates WordPress Publishing to Use WP REST API\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"guid\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:30:\"https://wptavern.com/?p=134148\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"link\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:80:\"https://wptavern.com/ulysses-app-updates-wordpress-publishing-to-use-wp-rest-api\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:11:\"description\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:2701:\"<img />\n\n\n\n<p><a href=\"https://ulysses.app/\">Ulysses</a>, a writing app for Mac, iPad, and iPhone, has <a href=\"https://ulysses.app/releases/\">released</a> version 26. This is an important update for those who use the app to write and publish to WordPress. It adds support for more blogs and has simplified the process of setting them up using the WordPress REST API.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Under the File > Publishing Preview menu, users with connected WordPress sites can see how their posts would look with the Twenty Twenty-One default theme. Here you can also manage external publishing accounts and add multiple WordPress blogs by authenticating for each one and authorizing the Ulysses app. (Accounts were previously available under a separate menu but are now found under the Publishing Previews screen.)</p>\n\n\n\n<img />\n\n\n\n<p>Ulysses has been around since 2003 &#8211; as long as WordPress, and has gained a loyal customer base over the past 19 years. It is run by a small team based in Leipzig, Germany. The app&#8217;s users are often attracted by its sophisticated support for writing projects, distraction-free writing interface, and clean design, which won an Apple Design Award in 2016. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>The app has supported publishing directly to WordPress since version 2.6, released in August 2016. Prior to this release, users had been exporting their posts as HTML or Markdown and pasting them into the WordPress editor. <a href=\"https://wptavern.com/ulysses-22-adds-wordpress-post-updating\">Version 22</a>, released in 2021, introduced Micro.blog publishing and WordPress post updating.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>In addition to the more modernized WordPress publishing integration, the latest update changes the publishing flow UI to feature dedicated buttons for quick access to publishing and the publishing preview. It also introduces a new counter on MacOS in the editor that shows the word count and pops out a little table of other stats on click, including characters, sentences, paragraphs, pages, and more.</p>\n\n\n\n<img />\n\n\n\n<p>Version 26 also fixes some sluggishness in the editor and eliminates a gaggle of annoying crash scenarios that users have been experiencing:</p>\n\n\n\n<ul id=\"block-4f7f6d69-01bc-4de2-961d-d09011b67cb4\"><li>Fixed a crash when sharing a sheet from Ulysses</li><li>Fixed a potential delay when typing in the editor</li><li>Fixed a rare crash on app launch</li><li>Fixed a crash when dragging a sheet from Mac to iPad using Universal Control</li></ul>\n\n\n\n<p>Ulysses users who want to find out what&#8217;s coming in upcoming releases can test new features before they come available by joining the app&#8217;s <a href=\"https://ulysses.app/beta/\">beta program</a> for iOS or macOS.</p>\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:7:\"pubDate\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:31:\"Mon, 09 May 2022 22:44:22 +0000\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}s:32:\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\";a:1:{s:7:\"creator\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:13:\"Sarah Gooding\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}}}i:46;a:6:{s:4:\"data\";s:13:\"\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";s:5:\"child\";a:2:{s:0:\"\";a:5:{s:5:\"title\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:89:\"Gutenberg Times: WordPress 6.0 Devnotes, Sneak Peeks and articles – Weekend edition 214\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"guid\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:35:\"https://gutenbergtimes.com/?p=21086\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"link\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:95:\"https://gutenbergtimes.com/wordpress-6-0-devnotes-sneak-peeks-and-articles-weekend-edition-214/\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:11:\"description\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:11117:\"<p>Howdy, </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Today&#8217;s Weekend Edition is full of WordPress 6.0 developer notes  and articles.

They were part of a larger theme project that I never finished. However, I had a ton of fun playing around with variations. Disliking them withering away on my laptop&#8217;s hard drive, I thought I would share them with the Tavern audience.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The base coupon card looks like the following:</p>\n\n\n\n<img />\n\n\n\n<p>When I designed it and the others, I had Christmas on my mind (if that was not obvious from the screenshot). Of course, I am always thinking about the holiday, usually starting my shopping by at least July each year.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Other than the image, I intentionally left most of the design generic so that it easily applies to other holidays and events.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>This tutorial in the <a href=\"https://wptavern.com/category/building-with-blocks\">Building with Blocks</a> series will walk you through each step of creating custom coupon cards from the editor. I will also share a couple of ideas for variations at the end.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2>Step 1: Adding a Group Block</h2>\n\n\n\n<img />Adding a Group block with custom background and border.\n\n\n\n<p>As with most patterns, you should start with a container-type block. For the coupon card, begin by inserting a Group. You are free to personalize this however you want. However, to use the same layout in the tutorial, you should at least set the block&#8217;s padding to <code>0px</code> and block spacing option to <code>0px</code>. Those need to be zeroed out for the rest of the design to work.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>I adjusted my Group block to have a light gray background color. Then, I added a <code>4px</code> dashed border and an <code>8px</code> border-radius. Each of these design tools is available in the block inspector in the sidebar panel. Have a little fun with colors and other settings until you find something you like.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2>Step 2: Add an Image</h2>\n\n\n\n<img />Inserting an Image block into the Group.\n\n\n\n<p>This step is straightforward. Insert an Image block inside of the Group from step #1. There are no particular settings required.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Of course, you should link it to something via the insert-link button in the toolbar. <em>You are presumably selling a product and want folks to click on it.</em></p>\n\n\n\n<h2>Step 3: Add Content Group</h2>\n\n\n\n<img />Adding a nested Group block.\n\n\n\n<p>This should be another simple step. Below the Image block from step #2, add a new Group. This will house the &#8220;content&#8221; you will add in step #4.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The most crucial setting for this block is to add padding via the block design tools in the sidebar panel. I opted for <code>2rem</code> to match my theme. Remember that you zeroed out the padding in the outer Group in step #1. Now, you need to add some to keep the content from butting against the side of the container.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2>Step 4: Add Content</h2>\n\n\n\n<img />Adding the sales pitch.\n\n\n\n<p>With the Group block in place from step #3, you have a new freeform area to throw in your sales pitch to potential customers. This can be as simple as a Heading followed by a Paragraph or something much more complex. It is probably best to keep it short and on point.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2>Step 5: Coupon Code Row</h2>\n\n\n\n<img />Inserting a Row block for coupon code section.\n\n\n\n<p>To highlight the coupon code, add a new Row block below the Group block added in step #3. This allows you to add a section for the code and expiration date in the next step.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Select the &#8220;space between items&#8221; option for the justification control. This setting pushes each nested block away from the other.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Then, select a custom background color. This should automatically give padding to the Row block. If you opt out of setting a color, you should manually set the padding to match the Group block above it.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2>Step 6: Add Code and Expiration</h2>\n\n\n\n<img />Custom coupon code and expiration date.\n\n\n\n<p>The final step is to add two Paragraph blocks into the Row container. The first should read something like &#8220;Coupon: XMAS2022,&#8221; and the second should be &#8220;Expires: December 31.&#8221;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Of course, it is your card, so have fun customizing it.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2>Variations</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>The wonderful thing about the WordPress block editor is there are so many ways that users can modify the output of a set of blocks like the above. Something as simple as changing the colors can give you an entirely different look. And, by rearranging a block or two, you can craft something uniquely your own.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>One of the easiest ways of customizing the coupon code above is by throwing in a few emoji, as shown in the following screenshot:</p>\n\n\n\n<img />Emoji variation.\n\n\n\n<p>OK. I was having a bit of fun with that. On a more serious note, there are many ways to tinker with the formula and create something new.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>It took me only a few moments to merge steps #2 and #4 (skipping step #3) from earlier to create the following:</p>\n\n\n\n<img />Media &amp; Text variation.\n\n\n\n<p>That is a Media &amp; Text block in the mix. I will leave you with the challenge of recreating this variation without a complete walkthrough.

Their assessment is aimed at the broader ecommerce space, but the topic is applicable to anyone with a site using third-party services with security and liability concerns.
